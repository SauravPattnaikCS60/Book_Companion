"<bos>You are an English literature expert who has solid ability of explaining complex things in a simple manner.\n\n    Context: 25    DARWIN\u2019S SINGULAR NOTION \n \n \n \n \nIN THE LATE summer or early autumn of 1859, Whitwell Elwin, editor of the respected \nBritish journal the Quarterly Review, was sent an advance copy of a new book by the \nnaturalist Charles Darwin. Elwin read the book with interest and agreed that it had merit, but \nfeared that the subject matter was too narrow to attract a wide audience. He urged Darwin to \nwrite a book about pigeons instead. \u201cEveryone is interested in pigeons,\u201d he observed \nhelpfully. \n    Elwin\u2019s sage advice was ignored, and On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural \nSelection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life was published in late \nNovember 1859, priced at fifteen shillings. The first edition of 1,250 copies sold out on the \nfirst day. It has never been out of print, and scarcely out of controversy, in all the time since\u2014\nnot bad going for a man whose principal other interest was earthworms and who, but for a \nsingle impetuous decision to sail around the world, would very probably have passed his life \nas an anonymous country parson known for, well, for an interest in earthworms. \n    Charles Robert Darwin was born on February 12, 1809,1 in Shrewsbury, a sedate market \ntown in the west Midlands of England. His father was a prosperous and well-regarded \nphysician. His mother, who died when Charles was only eight, was the daughter of Josiah \nWedgwood, of pottery fame. \n    Darwin enjoyed every advantage of upbringing, but continually pained his widowed father \nwith his lackluster academic performance. \u201cYou care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-\ncatching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family,\u201d his father wrote in a line \nthat nearly always appears just about here in any review of Darwin\u2019s early life. Although his \ninclination was to natural history, for his father\u2019s sake he tried to study medicine at Edinburgh \nUniversity but couldn\u2019t bear the blood and suffering. The experience of witnessing an \noperation on an understandably distressed child\u2014this was in the days before anesthetics, of \ncourse\u2014left him permanently traumatized. He tried law instead, but found that insupportably \ndull and finally managed, more or less by default, to acquire a degree in divinity from \nCambridge. \n    A life in a rural vicarage seemed to await him when from out of the blue there came a more \ntempting offer. Darwin was invited to sail on the naval survey ship HMS Beagle, essentially \nas dinner company for the captain, Robert FitzRoy, whose rank precluded his socializing with \nanyone other than a gentleman. FitzRoy, who was very odd, chose Darwin in part because he \nliked the shape of Darwin\u2019s nose. (It betokened depth of character, he believed.) Darwin was \nnot FitzRoy\u2019s first choice, but got the nod when FitzRoy\u2019s preferred companion dropped out. \nFrom a twenty-first-century perspective the two men\u2019s most striking joint feature was their \n                                                 \n1 An auspicious date in history: on the same day in Kentucky, Abraham Lincoln was born.extreme youthfulness. At the time of sailing, FitzRoy was only twenty-three, Darwin just \ntwenty-two. \n    FitzRoy\u2019s formal assignment was to chart coastal waters, but his hobby\u2014passion really\u2014\nwas to seek out evidence for a literal, biblical interpretation of creation. That Darwin was \ntrained for the ministry was central to FitzRoy\u2019s decision to have him aboard. That Darwin \nsubsequently proved to be not only liberal of view but less than wholeheartedly devoted to \nChristian fundamentals became a source of lasting friction between them. \n    Darwin\u2019s time aboard HMS Beagle, from 1831 to 1836, was obviously the formative \nexperience of his life, but also one of the most trying. He and his captain shared a small cabin, \nwhich can\u2019t have been easy as FitzRoy was subject to fits of fury followed by spells of \nsimmering resentment. He and Darwin constantly engaged in quarrels, some \u201cbordering on \ninsa\n\nnerously sent \nDarwin specimens that he thought might be of interest. In the process of these exchanges \nDarwin had discreetly warned Wallace that he regarded the subject of species creation as his \nown territory. \u201cThis summer will make the 20th year (!) since I opened my first note-book, on \nthe question of how & in what way do species & varieties differ from each other,\u201d he had \nwritten to Wallace some time earlier. \u201cI am now preparing my work for publication,\u201d he \nadded, even though he wasn\u2019t really. \nIn any case, Wallace failed to grasp what Darwin was trying to tell him, and of course he \ncould have no idea that his own theory was so nearly identical to one that Darwin had been \nevolving, as it were, for two decades. \nDarwin was placed in an agonizing quandary. If he rushed into print to preserve his priority, \nhe would be taking advantage of an innocent tip-off from a distant admirer. But if he stepped \naside, as gentlemanly conduct arguably required, he would lose credit for a theory that he had \nindependently propounded. Wallace\u2019s theory was, by Wallace\u2019s own admission, the result of a \nflash of insight; Darwin\u2019s was the product of years of careful, plodding, methodical thought. It \nwas all crushingly unfair. \nTo compound his misery, Darwin\u2019s youngest son, also named Charles, had contracted scarlet \nfever and was critically ill. At the height of the crisis, on June 28, the child died. Despite the \ndistraction of his son\u2019s illness, Darwin found time to dash off letters to his friends Charles \nLyell and Joseph Hooker, offering to step aside but noting that to do so would mean that all \nhis work, \u201cwhatever it may amount to, will be smashed.\u201d Lyell and Hooker came up with the \ncompromise solution of presenting a summary of Darwin\u2019s and Wallace\u2019s ideas together. The \nvenue they settled on was a meeting of the Linnaean Society, which at the time was struggling \nto find its way back into fashion as a seat of scientific eminence. On July 1, 1858, Darwin\u2019s \n                                                 \n2 Darwin was one of the few to guess correctly. He happened to be visiting Chambers one day when an advance \ncopy of the sixth edition of Vestiges was delivered. The keenness with which Chambers checked the revisions \nwas something of a giveaway, though it appears the two men did not discuss it.and Wallace\u2019s theory was unveiled to the world. Darwin himself was not present. On the day \nof the meeting, he and his wife were burying their son. \n    The Darwin\u2013Wallace presentation was one of seven that evening\u2014one of the others was on \nthe flora of Angola\u2014and if the thirty or so people in the audience had any idea that they were \nwitnessing the scientific highlight of the century, they showed no sign of it. No discussion \nfollowed. Nor did the event attract much notice elsewhere. Darwin cheerfully later noted that \nonly one person, a Professor Haughton of Dublin, mentioned the two papers in print and his \nconclusion was \u201cthat all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old.\u201d \n    Wallace, still in the distant East, learned of these maneuverings long after the event, but \nwas remarkably equable and seemed pleased to have been included at all. He even referred to \nthe theory forever after as \u201cDarwinism.\u201d Much less amenable to Darwin\u2019s claim of priority \nwas a Scottish gardener named Patrick Matthew who had, rather remarkably, also come up \nwith the principles of natural selection\u2014in fact, in the very year that Darwin had set sail in \ntheBeagle. Unfortunately, Matthew had published these views in a book called Naval Timber \nand Arboriculture, which had been missed not just by Darwin, but by the entire world. \nMatthew kicked up in a lively manner, with a letter to Gardener\u2019s Chronicle, when he saw \nDarwin gaining credit everywhere for an idea that really was his. Darwin apologized without \nhesitation, though he did note for the record: \u201cI think that no one will feel surprised that \nneither I, nor apparently any other\n\nn referred to \nthe theory forever after as \u201cDarwinism.\u201d Much less amenable to Darwin\u2019s claim of priority \nwas a Scottish gardener named Patrick Matthew who had, rather remarkably, also come up \nwith the principles of natural selection\u2014in fact, in the very year that Darwin had set sail in \ntheBeagle.

So the theory \nbecame, essentially by default, Darwin\u2019s alone. \n    Darwin never ceased being tormented by his ideas. He referred to himself as \u201cthe Devil\u2019s \nChaplain\u201d and said that revealing the theory felt \u201clike confessing a murder.\u201d Apart from all \nelse, he knew it deeply pained his beloved and pious wife. Even so, he set to work at once \nexpanding his manuscript into a book-length work. Provisionally he called it An Abstract of \nan Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties through Natural Selection \u2014a title so tepid \nand tentative that his publisher, John Murray, decided to issue just five hundred copies. But \nonce presented with the manuscript, and a slightly more arresting title, Murray reconsidered \nand increased the initial print run to 1,250. \n    On the Origin of Species was an immediate commercial success, but rather less of a critical \none. Darwin\u2019s theory presented two intractable difficulties. It needed far more time than Lord \nKelvin was willing to concede, and it was scarcely supported by fossil evidence. Where, \nasked Darwin\u2019s more thoughtful critics, were the transitional forms that his theory so clearly \ncalled for? If new species were continuously evolving, then there ought to be lots of \nintermediate forms scattered across the fossil record, but there were not.3 In fact, the record as \nit existed then (and for a long time afterward) showed no life at all right up to the moment of \nthe famous Cambrian explosion. \n                                                 \n3 By coincidence, in 1861, at the height of the controversy, just such evidence turned up when workers in \nBavaria found the bones of an ancient archaeopteryx, a creature halfway between a bird and a dinosaur. (It had \nfeathers, but it also had teeth.) It was an impressive and helpful find, and its significance much debated, but a \nsingle discovery could hardly be considered conclusive.But now here was Darwin, without any evidence, insisting that the earlier seas must have \nhad abundant life and that we just hadn\u2019t found it yet because, for whatever reason, it hadn\u2019t \nbeen preserved. It simply could not be otherwise, Darwin maintained. \u201cThe case at present \nmust remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here \nentertained,\u201d he allowed most candidly, but he refused to entertain an alternative possibility. \nBy way of explanation he speculated\u2014inventively but incorrectly\u2014that perhaps the \nPrecambrian seas had been too clear to lay down sediments and thus had preserved no fossils. \n    Even Darwin\u2019s closest friends were troubled by the blitheness of some of his assertions. \nAdam Sedgwick, who had taught Darwin at Cambridge and taken him on a geological tour of \nWales in 1831, said the book gave him \u201cmore pain tha\n\nnd that natural selection was the means by which some \nspecies prospered while others failed. Specifically what Darwin saw was that all organisms \ncompeted for resources, and those that had some innate advantage would prosper and pass on \nthat advantage to their offspring. By such means would species continuously improve. \n    It seems an awfully simple idea\u2014it is an awfully simple idea\u2014but it explained a great deal, \nand Darwin was prepared to devote his life to it. \u201cHow stupid of me not to have thought of \nit!\u201d T. H. Huxley cried upon reading On the Origin of Species. It is a view that has been \nechoed ever since.Interestingly, Darwin didn\u2019t use the phrase \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d in any of his work \n(though he did express his admiration for it). The expression was coined five years after the \npublication of On the Origin of Species by Herbert Spencer in Principles of Biology in 1864. \nNor did he employ the word evolution in print until the sixth edition of Origin (by which time \nits use had become too widespread to resist), preferring instead \u201cdescent with modification.\u201d \nNor, above all, were his conclusions in any way inspired by his noticing, during his time in \nthe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, an interesting diversity in the beaks of finches. The story as \nconventionally told (or at least as frequently remembered by many of us) is that Darwin, \nwhile traveling from island to island, noticed that the finches\u2019 beaks on each island were \nmarvelously adapted for exploiting local resources\u2014that on one island beaks were sturdy and \nshort and good for cracking nuts, while on the next island beaks were perhaps long and thin \nand well suited for winkling food out of crevices\u2014and it was this that set him to thinking that \nperhaps the birds had not been created this way, but had in a sense created themselves. \n    In fact, the birds had created themselves, but it wasn\u2019t Darwin who noticed it. At the time \nof the Beagle voyage, Darwin was fresh out of college and not yet an accomplished naturalist \nand so failed to see that the Gal\u00e1pagos birds were all of a type. It was his friend the \nornithologist John Gould who realized that what Darwin had found was lots of finches with \ndifferent talents. Unfortunately, in his inexperience Darwin had not noted which birds came \nfrom which islands. (He had made a similar error with tortoises.) It took years to sort the \nmuddles out. \n    Because of these oversights, and the need to sort through crates and crates of other Beagle \nspecimens, it wasn\u2019t until 1842, six years after his return to England, that Darwin finally \nbegan to sketch out the rudiments of his new theory. These he expanded into a 230-page \n\u201csketch\u201d two years later. And then he did an extraordinary thing: he put his notes away and \nfor the next decade and a half busied himself with other matters. He fathered ten children, \ndevoted nearly eight years to writing an exhaustive opus on barnacles (\u201cI hate a barnacle as no \nman ever did before,\u201d he sighed, understandably, upon the work\u2019s conclusion), and fell prey \nto strange disorders that left him chronically listless, faint, and \u201cflurried,\u201d as he put it. The \nsymptoms nearly always included a terrible nausea and generally also incorporated \npalpitations, migraines, exhaustion, trembling, spots before the eyes, shortness of breath, \n\u201cswimming of the head,\u201d and, not surprisingly, depression. \n    The cause of the illness has never been established, but the most romantic and perhaps \nlikely of the many suggested possibilities is that he suffered from Chagas\u2019s disease, a \nlingering tropical malady that he could have acquired from the bite of a Benchuga bug in \nSouth America. A more prosaic explanation is that his condition was psychosomatic. In either \ncase, the misery was not. Often he could work for no more than twenty minutes at a stretch, \nsometimes not that. \n    Much of the rest of his time was devoted to a series of increasingly desperate treatments\u2014\nicy plunge baths, dousings in vi\n\nny beneficial trait that arose in one generation would be passed on to subsequent \ngenerations, thus strengthening the species. \n    Jenkin pointed out that a favorable trait in one parent wouldn\u2019t become dominant in \nsucceeding generations, but in fact would be diluted through blending. If you pour whiskey \ninto a tumbler of water, you don\u2019t make the whiskey stronger, you make it weaker. And if you \npour that dilute solution into another glass of water, it becomes weaker still. In the same way, \nany favorable trait introduced by one parent would be successively watered down bysubsequent matings until it ceased to be apparent at all. Thus Darwin\u2019s theory was not a recipe \nfor change, but for constancy. Lucky flukes might arise from time to time, but they would \nsoon vanish under the general impulse to bring everything back to a stable mediocrity. If \nnatural selection were to work, some alternative, unconsidered mechanism was required. \n    Unknown to Darwin and everyone else, eight hundred miles away in a tranquil corner of \nMiddle Europe a retiring monk named Gregor Mendel was coming up with the solution. \n    Mendel was born in 1822 to a humble farming family in a backwater of the Austrian \nempire in what is now the Czech Republic. Schoolbooks once portrayed him as a simple but \nobservant provincial monk whose discoveries were largely serendipitous\u2014the result of \nnoticing some interesting traits of inheritance while pottering about with pea plants in the \nmonastery\u2019s kitchen garden. In fact, Mendel was a trained scientist\u2014he had studied physics \nand mathematics at the Olm\u00fctz Philosophical Institute and the University of Vienna\u2014and he \nbrought scientific discipline to all he did. Moreover, the monastery at Brno where he lived \nfrom 1843 was known as a learned institution. It had a library of twenty thousand books and a \ntradition of careful scientific investigation. \n    Before embarking on his experiments, Mendel spent two years preparing his control \nspecimens, seven varieties of pea, to make sure they bred true. Then, helped by two full-time \nassistants, he repeatedly bred and crossbred hybrids from thirty thousand pea plants. It was \ndelicate work, requiring them to take the most exacting pains to avoid accidental cross-\nfertilization and to note every slight variation in the growth and appearance of seeds, pods, \nleaves, stems, and flowers. Mendel knew what he was doing. \n    He never used the word gene \u2014it wasn\u2019t coined until 1913, in an English medical \ndictionary\u2014though he did invent the terms dominant and recessive. What he established was \nthat every seed contained two \u201cfactors\u201d or \u201celemente,\u201d as he called them\u2014a dominant one \nand a recessive one\u2014and these factors, when combined, produced predictable patterns of \ninheritance. \n    The results he converted into precise mathematical formulae. Altogether Mendel spent \neight years on the experiments, then confirmed his results with similar experiments on \nflowers, corn, and other plants. If anything, Mendel was too scientific in his approach, for \nwhen he presented his findings at the February and March meetings of the Natural History \nSociety of Brno in 1865, the audience of about forty listened politely but was conspicuously \nunmoved, even though the breeding of plants was a matter of great practical interest to many \nof the members. \n    When Mendel\u2019s report was published, he eagerly sent a copy to the great Swiss botanist \nKarl-Wilhelm von N\u00e4geli, whose support was more or less vital for the theory\u2019s prospects. \nUnfortunately, N\u00e4geli failed to perceive the importance of what Mendel had found. He \nsuggested that Mendel try breeding hawkweed. Mendel obediently did as N\u00e4geli suggested, \nbut quickly realized that hawkweed had none of the requisite features for studying heritability. \nIt was evident to him that N\u00e4geli had not read the paper closely, or possibly at all. Frustrated, \nMendel retired from investigating heritability and spent the rest of his life growi\n\nnd Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by \nInsects (1862), Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), which sold almost \n5,300 copies on its first day, The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilization in the Vegetable \nKingdom (1876)\u2014a subject that came improbably close to Mendel\u2019s own work, without \nattaining anything like the same insights\u2014and his last book, The Power of Movement in \nPlants. Finally, but not least, he devoted much effort to studying the consequences of \ninbreeding\u2014a matter of private interest to him. Having married his own cousin, Darwin \nglumly suspected that certain physical and mental frailties among his children arose from a \nlack of diversity in his family tree. \n    Darwin was often honored in his lifetime, but never for On the Origin of Species orDescent \nof Man. When the Royal Society bestowed on him the prestigious Copley Medal it was for his \ngeology, zoology, and botany, not evolutionary theories, and the Linnaean Society was \nsimilarly pleased to honor Darwin without embracing his radical notions. He was never \nknighted, though he was buried in Westminster Abbey\u2014next to Newton. He died at Down in \nApril 1882. Mendel died two years later. \n    Darwin\u2019s theory didn\u2019t really gain widespread acceptance until the 1930s and 1940s, with \nthe advance of a refined theory called, with a certain hauteur, the Modern Synthesis, \ncombining Darwin\u2019s ideas with those of Mendel and others. For Mendel, appreciation was \nalso posthumous, though it came somewhat sooner. In 1900, three scientists working \nseparately in Europe rediscovered Mendel\u2019s work more or less simultaneously. It was only \nbecause one of them, a Dutchman named Hugo de Vries, seemed set to claim Mendel\u2019s \ninsights as his own that a rival made it noisily clear that the credit really lay with the forgotten \nmonk. \n    The world was almost ready, but not quite, to begin to understand how we got here\u2014how \nwe made each other. It is fairly amazing to reflect that at the beginning of the twentieth \ncentury, and for some years beyond, the best scientific minds in the world couldn\u2019t actually \ntell you where babies came from. \n    And these, you may recall, were men who thought science was nearly at an end.\n\nnsidered with Reference to the Views \nof Mr. Darwin.\u201d \n    Finally, the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, rose to speak. Wilberforce had been \nbriefed (or so it is generally assumed) by the ardent anti-Darwinian Richard Owen, who had \nbeen a guest in his home the night before. As nearly always with events that end in uproar, \naccounts vary widely on what exactly transpired. In the most popular version, Wilberforce, \nwhen properly in flow, turned to Huxley with a dry smile and demanded of him whether he \nclaimed attachment to the apes by way of his grandmother or grandfather. The remark was \ndoubtless intended as a quip, but it came across as an icy challenge. According to his own \naccount, Huxley turned to his neighbor and whispered, \u201cThe Lord hath delivered him into my \nhands,\u201d then rose with a certain relish. \n    Others, however, recalled a Huxley trembling with fury and indignation. At all events, \nHuxley declared that he would rather claim kinship to an ape than to someone who used his \neminence to propound uninformed twaddle in what was supposed to be a serious scientific \nforum. Such a riposte was a scandalous impertinence, as well as an insult to Wilberforce\u2019s \noffice, and the proceedings instantly collapsed in tumult. A Lady Brewster fainted. Robert \nFitzRoy, Darwin\u2019s companion on the Beagle twenty-five years before, wandered through the \nhall with a Bible held aloft, shouting, \u201cThe Book, the Book.\u201d (He was at the conference to \npresent a paper on storms in his capacity as head of the newly created Meteorological \nDepartment.) Interestingly, each side afterward claimed to have routed the other.Darwin did eventually make his belief in our kinship with the apes explicit in The Descent \nof Man in 1871. The conclusion was a bold one since nothing in the fossil record supported \nsuch a notion. The only known early human remains of that time were the famous Neandertal \nbones from Germany and a few uncertain fragments of jawbones, and many respected \nauthorities refused to believe even in their antiquity. The Descent of Man was altogether a \nmore controversial book, but by the time of its appearance the world had grown less excitable \nand its arguments caused much less of a stir. \n    For the most part, however, Darwin passed his twilight years with other projects, most of \nwhich touched only tangentially on questions of natural selection. He spent amazingly long \nperiods picking through bird droppings, scrutinizing the contents in an attempt to understand \nhow seeds spread between continents, and spent years more studying the behavior of worms. \nOne of his experiments was to play the piano to them, not to amuse them but to study the \neffects on them of sound and vibration. He was the first to realize how vitally important \nworms are to soil fertility. \u201cIt may be doubted whether there are many other animals which \nhave played so important a part in the history of the world,\u201d he wrote in his masterwork on the \nsubject, The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms (1881), which was \nactually more popular thanOn the Origin of Species had ever been. Among his other books \nwere On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by \nInsects (1862), Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), which sold almost \n5,300 copies on its first day, The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilization in the Vegetable \nKingdom (1876)\u2014a subject that came improbably close to Mendel\u2019s own work, without \nattaining anything like the same insights\u2014and his last book, The Power of Movement in \nPlants. Finally, but not least, he devoted much effort to studying the consequences of \ninbreeding\u2014a matter of private interest to him. Having married his own cousin, Darwin \nglumly suspected that certain physical and mental frailties among his children arose from a \nlack of diversity in his family tree. \n    Darwin was often honored in his lifetime, but never for On the Origin of Species orDescent \nof Ma\n\nned politely but was conspicuously \nunmoved, even though the breeding of plants was a matter of great practical interest to many \nof the members. \n    When Mendel\u2019s report was published, he eagerly sent a copy to the great Swiss botanist \nKarl-Wilhelm von N\u00e4geli, whose support was more or less vital for the theory\u2019s prospects. \nUnfortunately, N\u00e4geli failed to perceive the importance of what Mendel had found.

Mendel obediently did as N\u00e4geli suggested, \nbut quickly realized that hawkweed had none of the requisite features for studying heritability. \nIt was evident to him that N\u00e4geli had not read the paper closely, or possibly at all. Frustrated, \nMendel retired from investigating heritability and spent the rest of his life growing \noutstanding vegetables and studying bees, mice, and sunspots, among much else. Eventually \nhe was made abbot. \n    Mendel\u2019s findings weren\u2019t quite as widely ignored as is sometimes suggested. His study \nreceived a glowing entry in the Encyclopaedia Britannica \u2014then a more leading record ofscientific thought than now\u2014and was cited repeatedly in an important paper by the German \nWilhelm Olbers Focke. Indeed, it was because Mendel\u2019s ideas never entirely sank below the \nwaterline of scientific thought that they were so easily recovered when the world was ready \nfor them. \n    Together, without realizing it, Darwin and Mendel laid the groundwork for all of life \nsciences in the twentieth century. Darwin saw that all living things are connected, that \nultimately they \u201ctrace their ancestry to a single, common source,\u201d while Mendel\u2019s work \nprovided the mechanism to explain how that could happen. The two men could easily have \nhelped each other. Mendel owned a German edition of the Origin of Species, which he is \nknown to have read, so he must have realized the applicability of his work to Darwin\u2019s, yet he \nappears to have made no effort to get in touch. And Darwin for his part is known to have \nstudied Focke\u2019s influential paper with its repeated references to Mendel\u2019s work, but didn\u2019t \nconnect them to his own studies. \n    The one thing everyone thinks featured in Darwin\u2019s argument, that humans are descended \nfrom apes, didn\u2019t feature at all except as one passing allusion. Even so, it took no great leap of \nimagination to see the implications for human development in Darwin\u2019s theories, and it \nbecame an immediate talking point. \n    The showdown came on Saturday, June 30, 1860, at a meeting of the British Association \nfor the Advancement of Science in Oxford. Huxley had been urged to attend by Robert \nChambers, author of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, though he was still unaware \nof Chambers\u2019s connection to that contentious tome. Darwin, as ever, was absent. The meeting \nwas held at the Oxford Zoological Museum. More than a thousand people crowded into the \nchamber; hundreds more were turned away. People knew that something big was going to \nhappen, though they had first to wait while a slumber-inducing speaker named John William \nDraper of New York University bravely slogged his way through two hours of introductory \nremarks on \u201cThe Intellectual Development of Europe Considered with Reference to the Views \nof Mr. Darwin.\u201d \n    Finally, the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, rose to speak. Wilberforce had been \nbriefed (or so it is generally assumed) by the ardent anti-Darwinian Richard Owen, who had \nbeen a guest in his home the night before. As nearly always with events that end in uproar, \naccounts vary widely on what exactly transpired. In the most popular version, Wilberforce, \nwhen properly in flow, turned to Huxley with a dry smile and demanded of him whether he \nclaimed attachment to the apes by way of his grandmother or grandfather. The remark was \ndoubtless intended as a quip, but it came across as an icy challenge. According to his own \naccount, Huxley turned to his neighbor and whispered, \u201cThe Lord hath delivered him into my \nha\n\nndant life and that we just hadn\u2019t found it yet because, for whatever reason, it hadn\u2019t \nbeen preserved. It simply could not be otherwise, Darwin maintained. \u201cThe case at present \nmust remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here \nentertained,\u201d he allowed most candidly, but he refused to entertain an alternative possibility. \nBy way of explanation he speculated\u2014inventively but incorrectly\u2014that perhaps the \nPrecambrian seas had been too clear to lay down sediments and thus had preserved no fossils. \n    Even Darwin\u2019s closest friends were troubled by the blitheness of some of his assertions. \nAdam Sedgwick, who had taught Darwin at Cambridge and taken him on a geological tour of \nWales in 1831, said the book gave him \u201cmore pain than pleasure.\u201d Louis Agassiz dismissed it  \nas poor conjecture. Even Lyell concluded gloomily: \u201cDarwin goes too far.\u201d \n    T. H. Huxley disliked Darwin\u2019s insistence on huge amounts of geological time because he \nwas a saltationist, which is to say a believer in the idea that evolutionary changes happen not \ngradually but suddenly. Saltationists (the word comes from the Latin for \u201cleap\u201d) couldn\u2019t \naccept that complicated organs could ever emerge in slow stages. What good, after all, is one-\ntenth of a wing or half an eye? Such organs, they thought, only made sense if they appeared in \na finished state. \n    The belief was surprising in as radical a spirit as Huxley because it closely recalled a very \nconservative religious notion first put forward by the English theologian William Paley in \n1802 and known as argument from design. Paley contended that if you found a pocket watch \non the ground, even if you had never seen such a thing before, you would instantly perceive \nthat it had been made by an intelligent entity. So it was, he believed, with nature: its \ncomplexity was proof of its design. The notion was a powerful one in the nineteenth century, \nand it gave Darwin trouble too. \u201cThe eye to this day gives me a cold shudder,\u201d he \nacknowledged in a letter to a friend. In the Origin he conceded that it \u201cseems, I freely confess, \nabsurd in the highest possible degree\u201d that natural selection could produce such an instrument \nin gradual steps. \n    Even so, and to the unending exasperation of his supporters, Darwin not only insisted that \nall change was gradual, but in nearly every edition of Origin he stepped up the amount of time \nhe supposed necessary to allow evolution to progress, which pushed his ideas increasingly out \nof favor. \u201cEventually,\u201d according to the scientist and historian Jeffrey Schwartz, \u201cDarwin lost \nvirtually all the support that still remained among the ranks of fellow natural historians and \ngeologists.\u201d \n    Ironically, considering that Darwin called his book On the Origin of Species, the one thing \nhe couldn\u2019t explain was how species originated. Darwin\u2019s theory suggested a mechanism for \nhow a species might become stronger or better or faster\u2014in a word, fitter\u2014but gave no \nindication of how it might throw up a new species. A Scottish engineer, Fleeming Jenkin, \nconsidered the problem and noted an important flaw in Darwin\u2019s argument. Darwin believed \nthat any beneficial trait that arose in one generation would be passed on to subsequent \ngenerations, thus strengthening the species. \n    Jenkin pointed out that a favorable trait in one parent wouldn\u2019t become dominant in \nsucceeding generations, but in fact would be diluted through blending. If you pour whiskey \ninto a tumbler of water, you don\u2019t make the whiskey stronger, you make it weaker. And if you \npour that dilute solution into another glass of water, it becomes weaker still. In the same way, \nany favorable trait introduced by one parent would be successively watered down bysubsequent matings until it ceased to be apparent at all. Thus Darwin\u2019s theory was not a recipe \nfor change, but for constancy. Lucky flukes might arise from time to time, but they would \nsoon vanish under the ge\n\n\n    \n    Question: Summarize the above text in 250 words covering the most important details.\n\n    Answer: he was a job posting his own-and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and the same as his own, and, and, and, and, and, and, and and and, and and and, and, and and and, and and, and and, and and, and and, and and and and and and and and, and and and, and and, and and, and and and, and, and, and, and, and, and and and and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and and and and, and, and and, and, and, and and, and, and, and and and and, and, and, and, and, and, and and and and and and and, and, and, and, and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and the same, and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and, and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and"
