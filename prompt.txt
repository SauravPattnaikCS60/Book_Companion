autumn of 1859 whitwell elwin editor of the respected nbritish journal the quarterly review was sent an advance copy of a new book by the nnaturalist charles darwin elwin read the book with interest and agreed that it had merit but nfeared that the subject matter was too narrow to attract a wide audience n elwin u2019s sage advice was ignored and on the origin of species by means of natural nselection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life was published in late nnovember 1859 priced at fifteen shillings n darwin enjoyed every advantage of upbringing but continually pained his widowed father nwith his lackluster academic performance u201cyou care for nothing but shooting dogs and rat ncatching and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family u201d his father wrote in a line nthat nearly always appears just about here in any review of darwin u2019s early life darwin was invited to sail on the naval survey ship hms beagle essentially nas

feature was their n n1 an auspicious date in history on the same day in kentucky abraham lincoln was born extreme youthfulness nto compound his misery darwin u2019s youngest son also named charles had contracted scarlet nfever and was critically ill at the height of the crisis on june 28 the child died the nvenue they settled on was a meeting of the linnaean society which at the time was struggling nto find its way back into fashion as a seat of scientific eminence darwin cheerfully later noted that nonly one person a professor haughton of dublin mentioned the two papers in print and his nconclusion was u201cthat all that was new in them was false and what was true was old u201d n wallace still in the distant east learned of these maneuverings long after the event but nwas remarkably equable and seemed pleased to have been included at all he even referred to nthe theory forever after as u201cdarwinism u201d much less amenable to darwin u2019s claim of priority nwas a scottish gardener named patrick matthew who had rather remarkably also come up nwith the principles of natural selection u2014in fact in the very year that darwin had set sail in nthebeagle unfortunately matthew had published these views in a book called naval timber nand arboriculture which had been missed not just by darwin but by the entire world darwin apologized without nhesitation though he did

views considering nhow briefly they are given and they appeared in the appendix to a work on naval timber nand arboriculture u201d n wallace continued for another fifty years as a naturalist and thinker occasionally a very ngood one but increasingly fell from scientific favor by taking up dubious interests such as nspiritualism and the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe provisionally he called it an abstract of nan essay on the origin of species and varieties through natural selection u2014a title so tepid nand tentative that his publisher john murray decided to issue just five hundred copies n n3 by coincidence in 1861 at the height of the controversy just such evidence turned up when workers in nbavaria found the bones of an ancient archaeopteryx a creature halfway between a bird and a dinosaur it was an impressive and helpful find and its significance much debated but a nsingle discovery could hardly be considered conclusive but now here was darwin without any evidence insisting that the earlier seas must have nhad abundant life and that we just hadn u2019t found it yet because for whatever reason it hadn u2019t nbeen preserved u201cthe case at present nmust remain inexplicable and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here nentertained u201d he allowed most candidly but he refused to entertain an alternative possibility nadam sedgwick who had taught darwin at cambridge and taken him on a geological tour of nwales in 1831 said the book gave him u201cmore pain tha n nnd that natural selection was the means by which

while pottering about with pea plants in the nmonastery u2019s kitchen garden n before embarking on his experiments mendel spent two years preparing his control nspecimens seven varieties of pea to make sure they bred true it was ndelicate work requiring them to take the most exacting pains to avoid accidental cross nfertilization and to note every slight variation in the growth and appearance of seeds pods nleaves stems and flowers if anything mendel was too scientific in his approach for nwhen he presented his findings at the february and march meetings of the natural history nsociety of

side afterward claimed to have routed the other darwin did eventually make his belief in our kinship with the apes explicit in the descent nof man in 1871 the only known early human remains of that time were the famous neandertal nbones from germany and a few uncertain fragments of jawbones and many respected nauthorities refused to believe even in their antiquity the descent of man was altogether a nmore controversial book but by the time of its appearance the world had grown less excitable nand its arguments caused much less of a stir u201cit may be doubted whether there are many other animals which nhave played so important a part in the history of the world u201d he wrote in his masterwork on the nsubject the formation of vegetable mould through the action of worms 1881 which was nactually more popular thanon the origin of species had ever been having married his own cousin darwin nglumly suspected that certain physical and mental frailties among his children arose

than now u2014and was cited repeatedly in an important paper by the german nwilhelm olbers focke darwin saw that all living things are connected that nultimately they u201ctrace their ancestry to a single common source u201d while mendel u2019s work nprovided the mechanism to explain how that could happen mendel owned a german edition of the origin of species which he is nknown to have read so he must have realized the applicability of his work to darwin u2019s yet he nappears to have made no effort to get in touch huxley had been urged to attend by robert nchambers author of vestiges of

lyell concluded gloomily u201cdarwin goes too far u201d n t h huxley disliked darwin u2019s insistence on huge amounts of geological time because he nwas a saltationist which is to say a believer in the idea that evolutionary changes happen not ngradually but suddenly n the belief was surprising in as radical a spirit as huxley because it closely recalled a very nconservative religious notion first put forward by the english theologian william paley in n1802 and known as argument from design paley contended that if you found a pocket watch non the ground even if you had never seen such a thing before you would instantly perceive nthat it had been made by an intelligent entity in the origin he conceded that it u201cseems i freely confess nabsurd in the highest possible degree u201d that natural selection could produce such an instrument nin gradual steps n even so and to the unending exasperation of his supporters darwin not only insisted that nall change was gradual but in nearly every edition of origin he stepped up the amount of time nhe supposed necessary to allow evolution to progress which pushed his ideas increasingly out nof favor \n    \n    Question: Summarize
