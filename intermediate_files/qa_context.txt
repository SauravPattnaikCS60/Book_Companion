"Chapter 3\nViking Sailors and Ships\nShips for Trading and Raiding \nThe jarl\u2019s family lived on a farm \nnestled between the fjords and the \nmountains. Ivar ran past the farm\u2019s \nstables and workshops, shouting for \nhis brothers. He found them playing outside the family\u2019s \nhouse.\n\u201cFather is home! His ship just arrived in the big fjord!\u201d The boys \nstopped playing and stared at their older brother.\n\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, you two! Harald, find Mother, and tell her the \ngood news. Rolf, go with Harald, and let Mother know that Father \nneeds all the wagons and lots of people to unload his\u00a0cargo.\u201d\n14\nThe Big Question\nWhy were ships so \nimportant to the \nViking way of life?Ivar\u2019s brothers were playing when he came home with the news of their father\u2019s return.\n1516\nIvar kept running. Soon he reached the sheltered beach. There he \nfound Olaf the Shipbuilder hard at work.\nOlaf and his fellow Vikings built some of the best ships in the world. \nThey lived in Scandinavia, a place with island, fjords, mountains \nand forests a\n\nn land for the evening. The sailors \nwould light campfires and hang big cooking pots over them. \nViking ships were sleek and fast, but while at sea they offered little protection to the \npeople on board.18\nWhen the ship sailed into the open ocean, the voyage would become \nmore difficult. The sea might be dotted with icebergs. The waves \ncould be fierce. While at sea, there were no cabins on Viking ships to \nprotect the sailors from bad weather. The sailors would be cold and \nwet most of the time. But when the ship was moored, or at anchor, a \ntent-like awning could be used to provide shelter. \nBuilding a Viking Ship\nOlaf\u2019s crew also built Viking warships. Ivar saw one of these mighty \nvessels resting at anchor nearby. Olaf had carved a serpent-like \ncreature on the warship\u2019s curved prow to frighten enemies. Ivar \nimagined the ship\u2019s brightly colored sail full in the wind.\nRight now, Olaf the Shipbuilder was carving a tree trunk into the long \nmast that would support the cargo ship\u2019s sail. All arou\n\nny Viking families had \nto move.17\nA Young Boy\u2019s Dream\nIvar did not want to leave his homeland, but he longed to sail \non one of these great ships. He had listened to the stories of the \nold sailors. He already knew how to find his way by using the sun \nand the stars as guides. And he knew what to do if his ship ever \ngot lost at sea: The Vikings had noticed that birds at sea usually \nflew toward land. So, they took caged birds with them on their \nocean voyages. If they became lost, the sailors simply released the \nbirds\u2014and followed them to safety. \nIvar imagined what it would be like to sail on a long journey. He \nknew that at the beginning of the voyage, the ship sailed close \nto the coastline and beached on land for the evening. The sailors \nwould light campfires and hang big cooking pots over them. \nViking ships were sleek and fast, but while at sea they offered little protection to the \npeople on board.18\nWhen the ship sailed into the open ocea\n\nnning.

So, they usually traveled by water. \nThey had to have excellent ships.\nOlaf and his crew were just finishing a large cargo ship. Ivar was \nalways amazed at how much a cargo ship could hold. These great \nvessels could carry all the things the Vikings needed when they \nmoved to faraway places. This happened a lot. Their homeland \nwas crowded, and there was not enough good land to farm. It \nsaddened Ivar to think that many Viking families had to move.\nAs towns in the Viking homeland grew and became crowded, many Viking families had \nto move.17\nA Young Boy\u2019s Dream\nIvar did not want to leave his homeland, but he longed to sail \non one of these great ships.
