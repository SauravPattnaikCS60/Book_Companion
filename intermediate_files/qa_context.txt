"ng simplicity in all this, too, owing to an equally \nelemental underlying unity in the way life works. All the tiny, deft chemical processes that \nanimate cells\u2014the cooperative efforts of nucleotides, the transcription of DNA into RNA\u2014\nevolved just once and have stayed pretty well fixed ever since across the whole of nature. As \nthe late French geneticist Jacques Monod put it, only half in jest: \u201cAnything that is true of E. \ncoli must be true of elephants, except more so.\u201d \n    Every living thing is an elaboration on a single original plan. As humans we are mere \nincrements\u2014each of us a musty archive of adjustments, adaptations, modifications, and \nprovidential tinkerings stretching back 3.8 billion years. Remarkably, we are even quiteclosely related to fruit and vegetables. About half the chemical functions that take place in a \nbanana are fundamentally the same as the chemical functions that take place in you. \n    It cannot be said too often: all life is one. That is, a\n\nnto a scalding vent below. In any case, as they made their way \nback to their dorm, they came across a stream that they had had to leap over earlier. They \nbacked up a few paces, linked arms and, on the count of three, took a running jump. In fact, it \nwasn\u2019t the stream at all. It was a boiling pool. In the dark they had lost their bearings. None of \nthe three survived. \n    I thought about this the next morning as I made a brief call, on my way out of the park, at a \nplace called Emerald Pool, in the Upper Geyser Basin. Doss hadn\u2019t had time to take me there \nthe day before, but I thought I ought at least to have a look at it, for Emerald Pool is a historic \nsite. \n    In 1965, a husband-and-wife team of biologists named Thomas and Louise Brock, while on \na summer study trip, had done a crazy thing. They had scooped up some of the yellowy-\nbrown scum that rimmed the pool and examined it for life. To their, and eventually the wider \nworld\u2019s, deep surprise, it was full of living microbes. They had fou\n\nn Museum of Natural History in New York has an absorbing diorama that \nrecords the moment of their passing. It depicts life-sized re-creations of a male and a female \nwalking side by side across the ancient African plain. They are hairy and chimplike in \ndimensions, but have a bearing and gait that suggest humanness. The most striking feature of \nthe display is that the male holds his left arm protectively around the female\u2019s shoulder. It is a \ntender and affecting gesture, suggestive of close bonding. \n    The tableau is done with such conviction that it is easy to overlook the consideration that \nvirtually everything above the footprints is imaginary. Almost every external aspect of the \ntwo figures\u2014degree of hairiness, facial appendages (whether they had human noses or chimp \nnoses), expressions, skin color, size and shape of the female\u2019s breasts\u2014is necessarily \nsuppositional. We can\u2019t even say that they were a couple. The female figure may in fact have \nbeen a child.
