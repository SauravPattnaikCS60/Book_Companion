"7    ELEMENTAL MATTERS \nCHEMISTRY AS AN earnest and respectable science is often said to date from 1661, when \nRobert Boyle of Oxford published The Sceptical Chymist \u2014the first work to distinguish \nbetween chemists and alchemists\u2014but it was a slow and often erratic transition. Into the \neighteenth century scholars could feel oddly comfortable in both camps\u2014like the German \nJohann Becher, who produced an unexceptionable work on mineralogy called Physica \nSubterranea , but who also was certain that, given the right materials, he could make himself \ninvisible. \n    Perhaps nothing better typifies the strange and often accidental nature of chemical science \nin its early days than a discovery made by a German named Hennig Brand in 1675. Brand \nbecame convinced that gold could somehow be distilled from human urine. (The similarity of \ncolor seems to have been a factor in his conclusion.) He assembled fifty buckets of human \nurine, which he kept for months in his cellar. By various recondite processes, he converted the \nurine first into a noxious paste and then into a translucent waxy substance. None of it yielded \ngold, of course, but a strange and interesting thing did happen. After a time, the substance \nbegan to glow. Moreover, when exposed to air, it often spontaneously burst into flame. \n    The commercial potential for the stuff\u2014which soon became known as phosphorus, from \nGreek and Latin roots meaning \u201clight bearing\u201d\u2014was not lost on eager businesspeople, but the \ndifficulties of manufacture made it too costly to exploit. An ounce of phosphorus retailed for \nsix guineas\u2014perhaps five hundred dollars in today\u2019s money\u2014or more than gold. \n    At first, soldiers were called on to provide the raw material, but such an arrangement was \nhardly conducive to industrial-scale production. In the 1750s a Swedish chemist named Karl \n(or Carl) Scheele devised a way to manufacture phosphorus in bulk without the slop or smell \nof urine. It was largely because of this mastery of phosphorus that Sweden became, and \nremains, a leading producer of matches. \n    Scheele was both an extraordinary and extraordinarily luckless fellow. A poor pharmacist \nwith little in the way of advanced apparatus, he discovered eight elements\u2014chlorine, fluorine, \nmanganese, barium, molybdenum, tungsten, nitrogen, and oxygen\u2014and got credit for none of \nthem. In every case, his finds were either overlooked or made it into publication after \nsomeone else had made the same discovery independently. He also discovered many useful \ncompounds, among them ammonia, glycerin, and tannic acid, and was the first to see the \ncommercial potential of chlorine as a bleach\u2014all breakthroughs that made other people \nextremely wealthy. \n    Scheele\u2019s one notable shortcoming was a curious insistence on tasting a little of everything \nhe worked with, including such notoriously disagreeable substances as mercury, prussic acid \n(another of his discoveries), and hydrocyanic acid\u2014a compound so famously poisonous that \n150 years later Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger chose it as his toxin of choice in a famous thought \nexperiment (see page 146). Scheele\u2019s rashness eventually caught up with him. In 1786, aged \njust forty-three, he was found dead at his workbench surrounded by an array of toxic \nchemicals, any one of which could have accounted for the stunned and terminal look on his \nface. \n    Were the world just and Swedish-speaking, Scheele would have enjoyed universal acclaim. \nInstead credit has tended to lodge with more celebrated chemists, mostly from the English-\nspeaking world. Scheele discovered oxygen in 1772, but for various heartbreakinglycomplicated reasons could not get his paper published in a timely manner. Instead credit went \nto Joseph Priestley, who discovered the same element independently, but latterly, in the \nsummer of 1774. Even more remarkable was Scheele\u2019s failure to receive credit for the \ndiscovery of chlorine. Nearly all textbooks still attribute chlorine\u2019s discovery to Humphry \nDavy, who did indeed find it, but thirty-six years after Scheele had. \n    Although chemistry had come a long way in the century that separated Newton and Boyle \nfrom Scheele and Priestley and Henry Cavendish, it still had a long way to go. Right up to the \nclosing years of the eighteenth century (and in Priestley\u2019s case a little beyond) scientists \neverywhere searched for, and sometimes believed they had actually found, things that just \nweren\u2019t there: vitiated airs, dephlogisticated marine acids, phloxes, calxes, terraqueous \nexhalations, and, above all, phlogiston, the substance that was thought to be the active agent \nin combustion. Somewhere in all this, it was thought, there also resided a mysterious \u00e9lan \nvital, the force that brought inanimate objects to life. No one knew where this ethereal essence \nlay, but two things seemed probable: that you could enliven it with a jolt of electricity (a \nnotion Mary Shelley exploited to full effect in her novel Frankenstein ) and that it existed in \nsome substances but not others, which is why we ended up with two branches of chemistry: \norganic (for those substances that were thought to have it) and inorganic (for those that did \nnot). \n    Someone of insight was needed to thrust chemistry into the modern age, and it was the \nFrench who provided him. His name was Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier. Born in 1743, Lavoisier \nwas a member of the minor nobility (his father had purchased a title for the family). In 1768, \nhe bought a practicing share in a deeply despised institution called the Ferme G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (or \nGeneral Farm), which collected taxes and fees on behalf of the government. Although \nLavoisier himself was by all accounts mild and fair-minded, the company he worked for was \nneither. For one thing, it did not tax the rich but only the poor, and then often arbitrarily. For \nLavoisier, the appeal of the institution was that it provided him with the wealth to follow his \nprincipal devotion, science. At his peak, his personal earnings reached 150,000 livres a year\u2014\nperhaps $20 million in today\u2019s money. \n    Three years after embarking on this lucrative career path, he married the fourteen-year-old \ndaughter of one of his bosses. The marriage was a meeting of hearts and minds both. Madame \nLavoisier had an incisive intellect and soon was working productively alongside her husband. \nDespite the demands of his job and busy social life, they managed to put in five hours of \nscience on most days\u2014two in the early morning and three in the evening\u2014as well as the \nwhole of Sunday, which they called their jour de bonheur (day of happiness). Somehow \nLavoisier also found the time to be commissioner of gunpowder, supervise the building of a \nwall around Paris to deter smugglers, help found the metric system, and coauthor the \nhandbook M\u00e9thode de Nomenclature Chimique , which became the bible for agreeing on the \nnames of the elements. \n    As a leading member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, he was also required to take an \ninformed and active interest in whatever was topical\u2014hypnotism, prison reform, the \nrespiration of insects, the water supply of Paris. It was in such a capacity in 1780 that \nLavoisier made some dismissive remarks about a new theory of combustion that had been \nsubmitted to the academy by a hopeful young scientist. The theory was indeed wrong, but the \nscientist never forgave him. His name was Jean-Paul Marat. \n    The one thing Lavoisier never did was discover an element. At a time when it seemed as if \nalmost anybody with a beaker, a flame, and some interesting powders could discoversomething new\u2014and when, not incidentally, some two-thirds of the elements were yet to be \nfound\u2014Lavoisier failed to uncover a single one. It certainly wasn\u2019t for want of beakers. \nLavoisier had thirteen thousand of them in what was, to an almost preposterous degree, the \nfinest private laboratory in existence. \n    Instead he took the discoveries of others and made sense of them. He threw out phlogiston \nand mephitic airs. He identified oxygen and hydrogen for what they were and gave them both \ntheir modern names. In short, he helped to bring rigor, clarity, and method to chemistry. \n    And his fancy equipment did in fact come in very handy. For years, he and Madame \nLavoisier occupied themselves with extremely exacting studies requiring the finest \nmeasurements. They determined, for instance, that a rusting object doesn\u2019t lose weight, as \neveryone had long assumed, but gains weight\u2014an extraordinary discovery. Somehow as it \nrusted the object was attracting elemental particles from the air. It was the first realization that \nmatter can be transformed but not eliminated. If you burned this book now, its matter would \nbe changed to ash and smoke, but the net amount of stuff in the universe would be the same. \nThis became known as the conservation of mass, and it was a revolutionary concept. \nUnfortunately, it coincided with another type of revolution\u2014the French one\u2014and for this one \nLavoisier was entirely on the wrong side. \n    Not only was he a member of the hated Ferme G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, but he had enthusiastically built \nthe wall that enclosed Paris\u2014an edifice so loathed that it was the first thing attacked by the \nrebellious citizens. Capitalizing on this, in 1791 Marat, now a leading voice in the National \nAssembly, denounced Lavoisier and suggested that it was well past time for his hanging. \nSoon afterward the Ferme G\u00e9n\u00e9rale was shut down. Not long after this Marat was murdered \nin his bath by an aggrieved young woman named Charlotte Corday, but by this time it was too \nlate for Lavoisier. \n    In 1793, the Reign of Terror, already intense, ratcheted up to a higher gear. In October \nMarie Antoinette was sent to the guillotine. The following month, as Lavoisier and his wife \nwere making tardy plans to slip away to Scotland, Lavoisier was arrested. In May he and \nthirty-one fellow farmers-general were brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal (in a \ncourtroom presided over by a bust of Marat). Eight were granted acquittals, but Lavoisier and \nthe others were taken directly to the Place de la Revolution (now the Place de la Concorde), \nsite of the busiest of French guillotines. Lavoisier watched his father-in-law beheaded, then \nstepped up and accepted his fate. Less than three months later, on July 27, Robespierre \nhimself was dispatched in the same way and in the same place, and the Reign of Terror \nswiftly ended. \n    A hundred years after his death, a statue of Lavoisier was erected in Paris and much \nadmired until someone pointed out that it looked nothing like him. Under questioning the \nsculptor admitted that he had used the head of the mathematician and philosopher the Marquis \nde Condorcet\u2014apparently he had a spare\u2014in the hope that no one would notice or, having \nnoticed, would care. In the second regard he was correct. The statue of Lavoisier-cum-\nCondorcet was allowed to remain in place for another half century until the Second World \nWar when, one morning, it was taken away and melted down for scrap. \n  \n    In the early 1800s there arose in England a fashion for inhaling nitrous oxide, or laughing \ngas, after it was discovered that its use \u201cwas attended by a highly pleasurable thrilling.\u201d Forthe next half century it would be the drug of choice for young people. One learned body, the \nAskesian Society, was for a time devoted to little else. Theaters put on \u201claughing gas \nevenings\u201d where volunteers could refresh themselves with a robust inhalation and then \nentertain the audience with their comical staggerings. \n    It wasn\u2019t until 1846 that anyone got around to finding a practical use for nitrous oxide, as \nan anesthetic. Goodness knows how many tens of thousands of people suffered unnecessary \nagonies under the surgeon\u2019s knife because no one thought of the gas\u2019s most obvious practical \napplication. \n    I mention this to make the point that chemistry, having come so far in the eighteenth \ncentury, rather lost its bearings in the first decades of the nineteenth, in much the way that \ngeology would in the early years of the twentieth. Partly it was to do with the limitations of \nequipment\u2014there were, for instance, no centrifuges until the second half of the century, \nseverely restricting many kinds of experiments\u2014and partly it was social. Chemistry was, \ngenerally speaking, a science for businesspeople, for those who worked with coal and potash \nand dyes, and not gentlemen, who tended to be drawn to geology, natural history, and physics. \n(This was slightly less true in continental Europe than in Britain, but only slightly.) It is \nperhaps telling that one of the most important observations of the century, Brownian motion, \nwhich established the active nature of molecules, was made not by a chemist but by a Scottish \nbotanist, Robert Brown. (What Brown noticed, in 1827, was that tiny grains of pollen \nsuspended in water remained indefinitely in motion no matter how long he gave them to \nsettle. The cause of this perpetual motion\u2014namely the actions of invisible molecules\u2014was \nlong a mystery.) \n    Things might have been worse had it not been for a splendidly improbable character named \nCount von Rumford, who, despite the grandeur of his title, began life in Woburn, \nMassachusetts, in 1753 as plain Benjamin Thompson. Thompson was dashing and ambitious, \n\u201chandsome in feature and figure,\u201d occasionally courageous and exceedingly bright, but \nuntroubled by anything so inconveniencing as a scruple. At nineteen he married a rich widow \nfourteen years his senior, but at the outbreak of revolution in the colonies he unwisely sided \nwith the loyalists, for a time spying on their behalf. In the fateful year of 1776, facing arrest \n\u201cfor lukewarmness in the cause of liberty,\u201d he abandoned his wife and child and fled just \nahead of a mob of anti-Royalists armed with buckets of hot tar, bags of feathers, and an \nearnest desire to adorn him with both. \n    He decamped first to England and then to Germany, where he served as a military advisor \nto the government of Bavaria, so impressing the authorities that in 1791 he was named Count \nvon Rumford of the Holy Roman Empire. While in Munich, he also designed and laid out the \nfamous park known as the English Garden. \n    In between these undertakings, he somehow found time to conduct a good deal of solid \nscience. He became the world\u2019s foremost authority on thermodynamics and the first to \nelucidate the principles of the convection of fluids and the circulation of ocean currents. He \nalso invented several useful objects, including a drip coffeemaker, thermal underwear, and a \ntype of range still known as the Rumford fireplace. In 1805, during a sojourn in France, he \nwooed and married Madame Lavoisier, widow of Antoine-Laurent. The marriage was not a \nsuccess and they soon parted. Rumford stayed on in France, where he died, universally \nesteemed by all but his former wives, in 1814.But our purpose in mentioning him here is that in 1799, during a comparatively brief \ninterlude in London, he founded the Royal Institution, yet another of the many learned \nsocieties that popped into being all over Britain in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth \ncenturies. For a time it was almost the only institution of standing to actively promote the \nyoung science of chemistry, and that was thanks almost entirely to a brilliant young man \nnamed Humphry Davy, who was appointed the institution\u2019s professor of chemistry shortly \nafter its inception and rapidly gained fame as an outstanding lecturer and productive \nexperimentalist. \n    Soon after taking up his position, Davy began to bang out new elements one after \nanother\u2014potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and aluminum or aluminium, \ndepending on which branch of English you favor.1 He discovered so many elements not so \nmuch because he was serially astute as because he developed an ingenious technique of \napplying electricity to a molten substance\u2014electrolysis, as it is known. Altogether he \ndiscovered a dozen elements, a fifth of the known total of his day. Davy might have done far \nmore, but unfortunately as a young man he developed an abiding attachment to the buoyant \npleasures of nitrous oxide. He grew so attached to the gas that he drew on it (literally) three or \nfour times a day. Eventually, in 1829, it is thought to have killed him. \n    Fortunately more sober types were at work elsewhere. In 1808, a dour Quaker named John \nDalton became the first person to intimate the nature of an atom (progress that will be \ndiscussed more completely a little further on), and in 1811 an Italian with the splendidly \noperatic name of Lorenzo Romano Amadeo Carlo Avogadro, Count of Quarequa and Cerreto, \nmade a discovery that would prove highly significant in the long term\u2014namely, that two \nequal volumes of gases of any type, if kept at the same pressure and temperature, will contain \nidentical numbers of molecules. \n    Two things were notable about Avogadro\u2019s Principle, as it became known. First, it \nprovided a basis for more accurately measuring the size and weight of atoms. Using \nAvogadro\u2019s mathematics, chemists were eventually able to work out, for instance, that a \ntypical atom had a diameter of 0.00000008 centimeters, which is very little indeed. And \nsecond, almost no one knew about Avogadro\u2019s appealingly simple principle for almost fifty \nyears.2  \n    Partly this was because Avogadro himself was a retiring fellow\u2014he worked alone, \ncorresponded very little with fellow scientists, published few papers, and attended no \nmeetings\u2014but also it was because there were no meetings to attend and few chemical \njournals in which to publish. This is a fairly extraordinary fact. The Industrial Revolution was \n                                                 \n1 The confusion over the aluminum/aluminium spelling arose b cause of some uncharacteristic indecisiveness on \nDavy's part. When he first isolated the element in 1808, he called it alumium. For son reason he thought better of \nthat and changed it to aluminum four years later. Americans dutifully adopted the new term, but mai British \nusers disliked aluminum, pointing out that it disrupted the -ium pattern established by sodium, calcium, and \nstrontium, so they added a vowel and syllable. \n2 The principle led to the much later adoption of Avogadro's number, a basic unit of measure in chemistry, which \nwas named for Avogadro long after his death. It is the number of molecules found in 2.016 grams of hydrogen \ngas (or an equal volume of any other gas). Its value is placed at 6.0221367 x 1023, which is an enormously large \nnumber. Chemistry students have long amused themselves by computing just how large a number it is, so I can \nreport that it is equivalent to the number of popcorn kernels needed to cover the United States to a depth of nine \nmiles, or cupfuls of water in the Pacific Ocean, or soft drink cans that would, evenly stacked, cover the Earth to a \ndepth of 200 miles. An equivalent number of American pennies would be enough to make every person on Earth \na dollar trillionaire. It is a big number.driven in large part by developments in chemistry, and yet as an organized science chemistry \nbarely existed for decades. \n    The Chemical Society of London was not founded until 1841 and didn\u2019t begin to produce a \nregular journal until 1848, by which time most learned societies in Britain\u2014Geological, \nGeographical, Zoological, Horticultural, and Linnaean (for naturalists and botanists)\u2014were at \nleast twenty years old and often much more. The rival Institute of Chemistry didn\u2019t come into \nbeing until 1877, a year after the founding of the American Chemical Society. Because \nchemistry was so slow to get organized, news of Avogadro\u2019s important breakthrough of 1811 \ndidn\u2019t begin to become general until the first international chemistry congress, in Karlsruhe, \nin 1860. \n    Because chemists for so long worked in isolation, conventions were slow to emerge. Until \nwell into the second half of the century, the formula H2O2might mean water to one chemist \nbut hydrogen peroxide to another. C2H4could signify ethylene or marsh gas. There was hardly \na molecule that was uniformly represented everywhere. \n    Chemists also used a bewildering variety of symbols and abbreviations, often self-invented. \nSweden\u2019s J. J. Berzelius brought a much-needed measure of order to matters by decreeing that \nthe elements be abbreviated on the basis of their Greek or Latin names, which is why the \nabbreviation for iron is Fe (from the Latin ferrum ) and that for silver is Ag (from the Latin \nargentum ). That so many of the other abbreviations accord with their English names (N for \nnitrogen, O for Oxygen, H for hydrogen, and so on) reflects English\u2019s Latinate nature, not its \nexalted status. To indicate the number of atoms in a molecule, Berzelius employed a \nsuperscript notation, as in H2O. Later, for no special reason, the fashion became to render the \nnumber as subscript: H2O. \n    Despite the occasional tidyings-up, chemistry by the second half of the nineteenth century \nwas in something of a mess, which is why everybody was so pleased by the rise to \nprominence in 1869 of an odd and crazed-looking professor at the University of St. Petersburg \nnamed Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleyev. \n    Mendeleyev (also sometimes spelled Mendeleev or Mendel\u00e9ef) was born in 1834 at \nTobolsk, in the far west of Siberia, into a well-educated, reasonably prosperous, and very \nlarge family\u2014so large, in fact, that history has lost track of exactly how many Mendeleyevs \nthere were: some sources say there were fourteen children, some say seventeen. All agree, at \nany rate, that Dmitri was the youngest. Luck was not always with the Mendeleyevs. When \nDmitri was small his father, the headmaster of a local school, went blind and his mother had \nto go out to work. Clearly an extraordinary woman, she eventually became the manager of a \nsuccessful glass factory. All went well until 1848, when the factory burned down and the \nfamily was reduced to penury. Determined to get her youngest child an education, the \nindomitable Mrs. Mendeleyev hitchhiked with young Dmitri four thousand miles to St. \nPetersburg\u2014that\u2019s equivalent to traveling from London to Equatorial Guinea\u2014and deposited \nhim at the Institute of Pedagogy. Worn out by her efforts, she died soon after. \n    Mendeleyev dutifully completed his studies and eventually landed a position at the local \nuniversity. There he was a competent but not terribly outstanding chemist, known more for \nhis wild hair and beard, which he had trimmed just once a year, than for his gifts in the \nlaboratory.However, in 1869, at the age of thirty-five, he began to toy with a way to arrange the \nelements. At the time, elements were normally grouped in two ways\u2014either by atomic weight \n(using Avogadro\u2019s Principle) or by common properties (whether they were metals or gases, \nfor instance). Mendeleyev\u2019s breakthrough was to see that the two could be combined in a \nsingle table. \n    As is often the way in science, the principle had actually been anticipated three years \npreviously by an amateur chemist in England named John Newlands. He suggested that when \nelements were arranged by weight they appeared to repeat certain properties\u2014in a sense to \nharmonize\u2014at every eighth place along the scale. Slightly unwisely, for this was an idea \nwhose time had not quite yet come, Newlands called it the Law of Octaves and likened the \narrangement to the octaves on a piano keyboard. Perhaps there was something in Newlands\u2019s \nmanner of presentation, but the idea was considered fundamentally preposterous and widely \nmocked. At gatherings, droller members of the audience would sometimes ask him if he could \nget his elements to play them a little tune. Discouraged, Newlands gave up pushing the idea \nand soon dropped from view altogether. \n    Mendeleyev used a slightly different approach, placing his elements into groups of seven, \nbut employed fundamentally the same principle. Suddenly the idea seemed brilliant and \nwondrously perceptive. Because the properties repeated themselves periodically, the invention \nbecame known as the periodic table. \n    Mendeleyev was said to have been inspired by the card game known as solitaire in North \nAmerica and patience elsewhere, wherein cards are arranged by suit horizontally and by \nnumber vertically. Using a broadly similar concept, he arranged the elements in horizontal \nrows called periods and vertical columns called groups. This instantly showed one set of \nrelationships when read up and down and another when read from side to side. Specifically, \nthe vertical columns put together chemicals that have similar properties. Thus copper sits on \ntop of silver and silver sits on top of gold because of their chemical affinities as metals, while \nhelium, neon, and argon are in a column made up of gases. (The actual, formal determinant in \nthe ordering is something called their electron valences, for which you will have to enroll in \nnight classes if you wish an understanding.) The horizontal rows, meanwhile, arrange the \nchemicals in ascending order by the number of protons in their nuclei\u2014what is known as their \natomic number. \n    The structure of atoms and the significance of protons will come in a following chapter, so \nfor the moment all that is necessary is to appreciate the organizing principle: hydrogen has \njust one proton, and so it has an atomic number of one and comes first on the chart; uranium \nhas ninety-two protons, and so it comes near the end and has an atomic number of ninety-two. \nIn this sense, as Philip Ball has pointed out, chemistry really is just a matter of counting. \n(Atomic number, incidentally, is not to be confused with atomic weight, which is the number \nof protons plus the number of neutrons in a given element.) There was still a great deal that \nwasn\u2019t known or understood. Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe, and yet \nno one would guess as much for another thirty years. Helium, the second most abundant \nelement, had only been found the year before\u2014its existence hadn\u2019t even been suspected \nbefore that\u2014and then not on Earth but in the Sun, where it was found with a spectroscope \nduring a solar eclipse, which is why it honors the Greek sun god Helios. It wouldn\u2019t be \nisolated until 1895. Even so, thanks to Mendeleyev\u2019s invention, chemistry was now on a firm \nfooting.For most of us, the periodic table is a thing of beauty in the abstract, but for chemists it \nestablished an immediate orderliness and clarity that can hardly be overstated. \u201cWithout a \ndoubt, the Periodic Table of the Chemical Elements is the most elegant organizational chart \never devised,\u201d wrote Robert E. Krebs in The History and Use of Our Earth\u2019s Chemical \nElements, and you can find similar sentiments in virtually every history of chemistry in print. \n    Today we have \u201c120 or so\u201d known elements\u2014ninety-two naturally occurring ones plus a \ncouple of dozen that have been created in labs. The actual number is slightly contentious \nbecause the heavy, synthesized elements exist for only millionths of seconds and chemists \nsometimes argue over whether they have really been detected or not. In Mendeleyev\u2019s day \njust sixty-three elements were known, but part of his cleverness was to realize that the \nelements as then known didn\u2019t make a complete picture, that many pieces were missing. His \ntable predicted, with pleasing accuracy, where new elements would slot in when they were \nfound. \n    No one knows, incidentally, how high the number of elements might go, though anything \nbeyond 168 as an atomic weight is considered \u201cpurely speculative,\u201d but what is certain is that \nanything that is found will fit neatly into Mendeleyev\u2019s great scheme. \n  \n    The nineteenth century held one last great surprise for chemists. It began in 1896 when \nHenri Becquerel in Paris carelessly left a packet of uranium salts on a wrapped photographic \nplate in a drawer. When he took the plate out some time later, he was surprised to discover \nthat the salts had burned an impression in it, just as if the plate had been exposed to light. The \nsalts were emitting rays of some sort. \n    Considering the importance of what he had found, Becquerel did a very strange thing: he \nturned the matter over to a graduate student for investigation. Fortunately the student was a \nrecent \u00e9migr\u00e9 from Poland named Marie Curie. Working with her new husband, Pierre, Curie \nfound that certain kinds of rocks poured out constant and extraordinary amounts of energy, \nyet without diminishing in size or changing in any detectable way. What she and her husband \ncouldn\u2019t know\u2014what no one could know until Einstein explained things the following \ndecade\u2014was that the rocks were converting mass into energy in an exceedingly efficient way. \nMarie Curie dubbed the effect \u201cradioactivity.\u201d In the process of their work, the Curies also \nfound two new elements\u2014polonium, which they named after her native country, and radium. \nIn 1903 the Curies and Becquerel were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in physics. (Marie \nCurie would win a second prize, in chemistry, in 1911, the only person to win in both \nchemistry and physics.) \n    At McGill University in Montreal the young New Zealand\u2013born Ernest Rutherford became \ninterested in the new radioactive materials. With a colleague named Frederick Soddy he \ndiscovered that immense reserves of energy were bound up in these small amounts of matter, \nand that the radioactive decay of these reserves could account for most of the Earth\u2019s warmth. \nThey also discovered that radioactive elements decayed into other elements\u2014that one day \nyou had an atom of uranium, say, and the next you had an atom of lead. This was truly \nextraordinary. It was alchemy, pure and simple; no one had ever imagined that such a thing \ncould happen naturally and spontaneously. \n    Ever the pragmatist, Rutherford was the first to see that there could be a valuable practical \napplication in this. He noticed that in any sample of radioactive material, it always took thesame amount of time for half the sample to decay\u2014the celebrated half-life\u2014and that this \nsteady, reliable rate of decay could be used as a kind of clock. By calculating backwards from \nhow much radiation a material had now and how swiftly it was decaying, you could work out \nits age. He tested a piece of pitchblende, the principal ore of uranium, and found it to be 700 \nmillion years old\u2014very much older than the age most people were prepared to grant the \nEarth. \n    In the spring of 1904, Rutherford traveled to London to give a lecture at the Royal \nInstitution\u2014the august organization founded by Count von Rumford only 105 years before, \nthough that powdery and periwigged age now seemed a distant eon compared with the roll-\nyour-sleeves-up robustness of the late Victorians. Rutherford was there to talk about his new \ndisintegration theory of radioactivity, as part of which he brought out his piece of pitchblende. \nTactfully\u2014for the aging Kelvin was present, if not always fully awake\u2014Rutherford noted \nthat Kelvin himself had suggested that the discovery of some other source of heat would \nthrow his calculations out. Rutherford had found that other source. Thanks to radioactivity the \nEarth could be\u2014and self-evidently was\u2014much older than the twenty-four million years \nKelvin\u2019s calculations allowed. \n    Kelvin beamed at Rutherford\u2019s respectful presentation, but was in fact unmoved. He never \naccepted the revised figures and to his dying day believed his work on the age of the Earth his \nmost astute and important contribution to science\u2014far greater than his work on \nthermodynamics. \n    As with most scientific revolutions, Rutherford\u2019s new findings were not universally \naccepted. John Joly of Dublin strenuously insisted well into the 1930s that the Earth was no \nmore than eighty-nine million years old, and was stopped only then by his own death. Others \nbegan to worry that Rutherford had now given them too much time. But even with \nradiometric dating, as decay measurements became known, it would be decades before we got \nwithin a billion years or so of Earth\u2019s actual age. Science was on the right track, but still way \nout. \n    Kelvin died in 1907. That year also saw the death of Dmitri Mendeleyev. Like Kelvin, his \nproductive work was far behind him, but his declining years were notably less serene. As he \naged, Mendeleyev became increasingly eccentric\u2014he refused to acknowledge the existence \nof radiation or the electron or anything else much that was new\u2014and difficult. His final \ndecades were spent mostly storming out of labs and lecture halls all across Europe. In 1955, \nelement 101 was named mendelevium in his honor. \u201cAppropriately,\u201d notes Paul Strathern, \u201cit \nis an unstable element.\u201d \n    Radiation, of course, went on and on, literally and in ways nobody expected. In the early \n1900s Pierre Curie began to experience clear signs of radiation sickness\u2014notably dull aches \nin his bones and chronic feelings of malaise\u2014which doubtless would have progressed \nunpleasantly. We shall never know for certain because in 1906 he was fatally run over by a \ncarriage while crossing a Paris street. \n    Marie Curie spent the rest of her life working with distinction in the field, helping to found \nthe celebrated Radium Institute of the University of Paris in 1914. Despite her two Nobel \nPrizes, she was never elected to the Academy of Sciences, in large part because after the death \nof Pierre she conducted an affair with a married physicist that was sufficiently indiscreet to \nscandalize even the French\u2014or at least the old men who ran the academy, which is perhaps \nanother matter.For a long time it was assumed that anything so miraculously energetic as radioactivity \nmust be beneficial. For years, manufacturers of toothpaste and laxatives put radioactive \nthorium in their products, and at least until the late 1920s the Glen Springs Hotel in the Finger \nLakes region of New York (and doubtless others as well) featured with pride the therapeutic \neffects of its \u201cRadioactive mineral springs.\u201d Radioactivity wasn\u2019t banned in consumer \nproducts until 1938. By this time it was much too late for Madame Curie, who died of \nleukemia in 1934. Radiation, in fact, is so pernicious and long lasting that even now her \npapers from the 1890s\u2014even her cookbooks\u2014are too dangerous to handle. Her lab books are \nkept in lead-lined boxes, and those who wish to see them must don protective clothing. \n    Thanks to the devoted and unwittingly high-risk work of the first atomic scientists, by the \nearly years of the twentieth century it was becoming clear that Earth was unquestionably \nvenerable, though another half century of science would have to be done before anyone could \nconfidently say quite how venerable. Science, meanwhile, was about to get a new age of its \nown\u2014the atomic one.PART  III   A NEW AGE DAWNS \n \n \n \n \nA Physicist is the atoms\u2019 way of thinking about atoms. \n \n \n \n-Anonymous"
