"You are an English literature expert who has solid ability of explaining complex things in a simple manner.\n\n    Context:  7 elemental matters nchemistry as an earnest and respectable science is often said to date from 1661 when nrobert boyle of oxford published the sceptical chymist u2014the first work to distinguish nbetween chemists and alchemists u2014but it was a slow and often erratic transition into the neighteenth century scholars could feel oddly comfortable in both camps u2014like the german njohann becher who produced an unexceptionable work on mineralogy called physica nsubterranea but who also was certain that given the right materials he could make himself ninvisible n perhaps nothing better typifies the strange and often accidental nature of chemical science nin its early days than a discovery made by a german named hennig brand in 1675 n the commercial potential for the stuff u2014which soon became known as phosphorus from ngreek and latin roots meaning u201clight bearing u201d u2014was not lost on eager businesspeople but the ndifficulties of manufacture made it too costly to exploit in the 1750s a swedish chemist named karl n or carl scheele devised a way to manufacture phosphorus in bulk without the slop or smell nof urine a poor pharmacist nwith little in the way of advanced apparatus he discovered eight elements u2014chlorine fluorine nmanganese barium molybdenum tungsten nitrogen and oxygen u2014and got credit for none of nthem he also discovered many useful ncompounds among them ammonia glycerin and tannic acid and was the first to see the ncommercial potential of chlorine as a bleach u2014all breakthroughs that made other people nextremely wealthy n scheele u2019s one notable shortcoming was a curious insistence on tasting a little of everything nhe worked with including such notoriously disagreeable substances as mercury prussic acid n another of his discoveries and hydrocyanic acid u2014a compound so famously poisonous that n150 years later erwin schr u00f6dinger chose it as his toxin of choice in a famous thought nexperiment see page 146 in 1786 aged njust forty three he was found dead at his workbench surrounded by an array of toxic nchemicals any one of which could have accounted for the stunned and terminal look on his nface right up to the nclosing years of the eighteenth century and in priestley u2019s

ferme g u00e9n u00e9rale or ngeneral farm which collected taxes and fees on behalf of the government ndespite the demands of his job and busy social life they managed to put in five hours of nscience on most days u2014two in the early morning and three in the evening u2014as well as the nwhole of sunday which they called their jour de bonheur day of happiness n as a leading member of the acad u00e9mie royale des sciences he was also required to take an ninformed and active interest in whatever was topical u2014hypnotism prison reform the nrespiration of insects the water supply of paris it was in such a capacity in 1780 that nlavoisier made some dismissive remarks about a new theory of combustion that had been nsubmitted to the academy by a hopeful young scientist at a time when it seemed as if nalmost anybody with a beaker a flame and some interesting powders could discoversomething new u2014and when not incidentally some two thirds of the elements were yet to be nfound u2014lavoisier failed to uncover a single one they determined for instance that a rusting object doesn u2019t lose weight as neveryone had long assumed but gains weight u2014an extraordinary discovery if you burned this book now its matter would nbe changed to ash and smoke but the net amount of stuff in the universe would be the same n not only was he a member of the hated ferme g u00e9n u00e9rale but he had enthusiastically built nthe wall that enclosed paris u2014an edifice so loathed that it was the first thing attacked by the nrebellious citizens capitalizing on this in 1791 marat now a leading voice in the national nassembly denounced lavoisier and suggested that it was well past time for his hanging not long after this marat was murdered nin his bath by an aggrieved young woman named charlotte corday but by this time it was too nlate for lavoisier the statue of lavoisier cum ncondorcet was allowed to remain in place for another half century until the second world nwar when one morning it was taken away and melted down for scrap n n in the early 1800s there arose in england a fashion for inhaling nitrous oxide or laughing ngas after it was discovered that its use u201cwas attended by a highly pleasurable thrilling u201d forthe next half century it would be the drug of choice for young people goodness knows how many tens of thousands of people suffered unnecessary nagonies under the surgeon u2019s knife because no one thought of the gas u2019s most obvious practical napplication n i mention this to make the point that chemistry having come so far in the eighteenth ncentury rather lost its bearings in the first decades of the nineteenth in much the way that ngeology would in the early years of the twentieth chemistry was ngenerally speaking a science for businesspeople for those who worked with coal and potash nand dyes and not gentlemen who tended to be drawn to geology natural history and physics it is nperhaps telling that one of the most important observations of the century brownian motion nwhich established the active nature of molecules was made not by a chemist but by a scottish nbotanist robert brown what brown noticed in 1827 was that tiny grains of pollen nsuspended in water remained indefinitely in motion no matter how long he gave them to nsettle n things might have been worse had it not been for a splendidly improbable character named ncount von rumford who despite the grandeur of his title began life in woburn nmassachusetts in 1753 as plain benjamin thompson thompson was dashing and ambitious n u201chandsome in feature and figure u201d occasionally courageous and exceedingly bright but nuntroubled by anything so inconveniencing as a scruple at nineteen he married a rich widow nfourteen years his senior but at the outbreak of revolution in the colonies he unwisely sided nwith the loyalists for a time spying on their behalf in the fateful year of 1776 facing arrest n u201cfor lukewarmness in the cause of liberty u201d he abandoned his wife and child and fled just nahead of a mob of anti royalists armed with buckets of hot tar bags of feathers and an nearnest desire to adorn him with both n he decamped first to england and then to germany where he served as a military advisor nto the government of bavaria so impressing the authorities that in 1791 he was named count nvon rumford of the holy roman empire he nalso invented several useful objects including a drip coffeemaker thermal underwear and a ntype of range still known as the rumford fireplace rumford stayed on in france where he died universally nesteemed by all but his former wives in 1814 but our purpose in mentioning him here is that in 1799 during a comparatively brief ninterlude in london he founded the royal institution yet another of the many learned nsocieties that popped into being all over britain in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth ncenturies in 1808 a dour quaker named john ndalton became the first person to intimate the nature of an atom progress that will be ndiscussed more completely a little further on and in 1811 an italian with the splendidly noperatic name of lorenzo romano amadeo carlo avogadro count of quarequa and cerreto nmade a discovery that would prove highly significant in the long term u2014namely that two nequal volumes of gases of any type if kept at the same pressure and temperature will contain nidentical numbers of molecules americans dutifully adopted the new term but mai british nusers disliked aluminum pointing out that it disrupted the ium pattern established by sodium calcium and nstrontium so they added a vowel and syllable chemistry students have long amused themselves by computing just how large a number it is so i can nreport that it is equivalent to the number of popcorn kernels needed to cover the united states to a depth of nine nmiles or cupfuls of water in the pacific ocean or soft drink cans that would evenly stacked cover the earth to a ndepth of 200 miles because nchemistry was so slow to get organized news of avogadro u2019s important breakthrough of 1811 ndidn u2019t begin to become general until the first international chemistry congress in karlsruhe nin 1860 that so many of the other abbreviations accord with their english names n for nnitrogen o for oxygen h for hydrogen and so on reflects english u2019s latinate nature not its nexalted status n despite the occasional tidyings up chemistry by the second half of the nineteenth century nwas in something of a mess which is why everybody was so pleased by the rise to nprominence in 1869 of an odd and crazed looking professor at the university of st petersburg nnamed dmitri ivanovich mendeleyev determined to get her youngest child an education the nindomitable mrs mendeleyev hitchhiked with young dmitri four thousand miles to st npetersburg u2014that u2019s equivalent to traveling from london to equatorial guinea u2014and deposited nhim at the institute of pedagogy there he was a competent but not terribly outstanding chemist known more for nhis wild hair and beard which he had trimmed just once a year than for his gifts in the nlaboratory however in 1869 at the age of thirty five he began to toy with a way to arrange the nelements at the time elements were normally grouped in two ways u2014either by atomic weight n using avogadro u2019s principle or by common properties whether they were metals or gases nfor instance n as is often the way in science the principle had actually been anticipated three years npreviously by an amateur chemist in england named john newlands even so thanks to mendeleyev u2019s invention chemistry was now on a firm nfooting for most of us the periodic table is a thing of beauty in the abstract but for chemists it nestablished an immediate orderliness and clarity that can hardly be overstated the actual number is slightly contentious nbecause the heavy synthesized elements exist for only millionths of seconds and chemists nsometimes argue over whether they have really been detected or not in mendeleyev u2019s day njust sixty three elements were known but part of his cleverness was to realize that the nelements as then known didn u2019t make a complete picture that many pieces were missing n no one knows incidentally how high the number of elements might go though anything nbeyond 168 as an atomic weight is considered u201cpurely speculative u201d but what is certain is that nanything that is found will fit neatly into mendeleyev u2019s great scheme it began in 1896 when nhenri becquerel in paris carelessly left a packet of uranium salts on a wrapped photographic nplate in a drawer n considering the importance of what he had found becquerel did a very strange thing he nturned the matter over to a graduate student for investigation working with her new husband pierre curie nfound that certain kinds of rocks poured out constant and extraordinary amounts of energy nyet without diminishing in size or changing in any detectable way what she and her husband ncouldn u2019t know u2014what no one could know until einstein explained things the following ndecade u2014was that the rocks were converting mass into energy in an exceedingly efficient way he tested a piece of pitchblende the principal ore of uranium and found it to be 700 nmillion years old u2014very much older than the age most people were prepared to grant the nearth n in the spring of 1904 rutherford traveled to london to give a lecture at the royal ninstitution u2014the august organization founded by count von rumford only 105 years before nthough that powdery and periwigged age now seemed a distant eon compared with the roll nyour sleeves up robustness of the late victorians john joly of dublin strenuously insisted well into the 1930s that the earth was no nmore than eighty nine million years old and was stopped only then by his own death in the early n1900s pierre curie began to experience clear signs of radiation sickness u2014notably dull aches nin his bones and chronic feelings of malaise u2014which doubtless would have progressed nunpleasantly n marie curie spent the rest of her life working with distinction in the field helping to found nthe celebrated radium institute of the university of paris in 1914 despite her two nobel nprizes she was never elected to the academy of sciences in large part because after the death nof pierre she conducted an affair with a married physicist that was sufficiently indiscreet to nscandalize even the french u2014or at least the old men who ran the academy which is perhaps nanother matter for a long time it was assumed that anything so miraculously energetic as radioactivity nmust be beneficial \n    \n    Question: Summarize the
