And congratulations. I am delighted that you could make it. Getting here wasn't \neasy, I know. In fact, I suspect it was a little tougher than you realize. \n    To begin with, for you to be here now trillions of drifting atoms had somehow to assemble \nin an intricate and intriguingly obliging manner to create you. It's an arrangement so \nspecialized and particular that it has never been tried before and will only exist this once. For \nthe next many years (we hope) these tiny particles will uncomplainingly engage in all the \nbillions of deft, cooperative efforts necessary to keep you intact and let you experience the \nsupremely agreeable but generally underappreciated state known as existence. \n    Why atoms take this trouble is a bit of a puzzle. Being you is not a gratifying experience at \nthe atomic level. For all their devoted attention, your atoms don't actually care about you-\nindeed, don't even know that you are there. They don't even know that they are there. They are \nmindless particles, after all, and not even themselves alive. (It is a slightly arresting notion \nthat if you were to pick yourself apart with tweezers, one atom at a time, you would produce a \nmound of fine atomic dust, none of which had ever been alive but all of which had once been \nyou.) Yet somehow for the period of your existence they will answer to a single overarching \nimpulse: to keep you you. \n    The bad news is that atoms are fickle and their time of devotion is fleeting-fleeting indeed. \nEven a long human life adds up to only about 650,000 hours. And when that modest \nmilestone flashes past, or at some other point thereabouts, for reasons unknown your atoms \nwill shut you down, silently disassemble, and go off to be other things. And that's it for you. \n    Still, you may rejoice that it happens at all. Generally speaking in the universe it doesn't, so \nfar as we can tell. This is decidedly odd because the atoms that so liberally and congenially \nflock together to form living things on Earth are exactly the same atoms that decline to do it \nelsewhere. Whatever else it may be, at the level of chemistry life is curiously mundane: \ncarbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, a little calcium, a dash of sulfur, a light dusting of \nother very ordinary elements-nothing you wouldn't find in any ordinary drugstore-and that's \nall you need. The only thing special about the atoms that make you is that they make you. \nThat is of course the miracle of life. \n    Whether or not atoms make life in other corners of the universe, they make plenty else; \nindeed, they make everything else. Without them there would be no water or air or rocks, no \nstars and planets, no distant gassy clouds or swirling nebulae or any of the other things that \nmake the universe so usefully material. Atoms are so numerous and necessary that we easily \noverlook that they needn't actually exist at all. There is no law that requires the universe to fill \nitself with small particles of matter or to produce light and gravity and the other physical \nproperties on which our existence hinges. There needn't actually be a universe at all. For the \nlongest time there wasn't. There were no atoms and no universe for them to float about in. \nThere was nothing-nothing at all anywhere. \n    So thank goodness for atoms. But the fact that you have atoms and that they assemble in \nsuch a willing manner is only part of what got you here. To be here now, alive in the twenty-\nfirst century and smart enough to know it, you also had to be the beneficiary of an \nextraordinary string of biological good fortune. Survival on Earth is a surprisingly tricky \nbusiness. Of the billions and billions of species of living thing that have existed since the \ndawn of time, most-99.99 percent-are no longer around. Life on Earth, you see, is not onlybrief but dismayingly tenuous. It is a curious feature of our existence that we come from a \nplanet that is very good at promoting life but even better at extinguishing it. \n    The average species on Earth lasts for only about four million years, so if you wish to be \naround for billions of years, you must be as fickle as the atoms that made you. You must be \nprepared to change everything about yourself-shape, size, color, species affiliation, \neverything-and to do so repeatedly. That's much easier said than done, because the process of \nchange is random. To get from \"protoplasmal primordial atomic globule\" (as the Gilbert and \nSullivan song put it) to sentient upright modern human has required you to mutate new traits \nover and over in a precisely timely manner for an exceedingly long while. So at various \nperiods over the last 3.8 billion years you have abhorred oxygen and then doted on it, grown \nfins and limbs and jaunty sails, laid eggs, flicked the air with a forked tongue, been sleek, \nbeen furry, lived underground, lived in trees, been as big as a deer and as small as a mouse, \nand a million things more. The tiniest deviation from any of these evolutionary shifts, and you \nmight now be licking algae from cave walls or lolling walrus-like on some stony shore or \ndisgorging air through a blowhole in the top of your head before diving sixty feet for a \nmouthful of delicious sandworms. \n    Not only have you been lucky enough to be attached since time immemorial to a favored \nevolutionary line, but you have also been extremely-make that miraculously-fortunate in your \npersonal ancestry. Consider the fact that for 3.8 billion years, a period of time older than the \nEarth's mountains and rivers and oceans, every one of your forebears on both sides has been \nattractive enough to find a mate, healthy enough to reproduce, and sufficiently blessed by fate \nand circumstances to live long enough to do so. Not one of your pertinent ancestors was \nsquashed, devoured, drowned, starved, stranded, stuck fast, untimely wounded, or otherwise \ndeflected from its life's quest of delivering a tiny charge of genetic material to the right \npartner at the right moment in order to perpetuate the only possible sequence of hereditary \ncombinations that could result-eventually, astoundingly, and all too briefly-in you. \n \n \nThis is a book about how it happened-in particular how we went from there being nothing at \nall to there being something, and then how a little of that something turned into us, and also \nsome of what happened in between and since. That's a great deal to cover, of course, which is \nwhy the book is called A Short History of Nearly Everything, even though it isn't really. It \ncouldn't be. But with luck by the time we finish it will feel as if it is. \n    My own starting point, for what it's worth, was an illustrated science book that I had as a \nclassroom text when I was in fourth or fifth grade. The book was a standard-issue 1950s \nschoolbookbattered, unloved, grimly hefty-but near the front it had an illustration that just \ncaptivated me: a cutaway diagram showing the Earth's interior as it would look if you cut into \nthe planet with a large knife and carefully withdrew a wedge representing about a quarter of \nits bulk. \n    It's hard to believe that there was ever a time when I had not seen such an illustration \nbefore, but evidently I had not for I clearly remember being transfixed. I suspect, in honesty, \nmy initial interest was based on a private image of streams of unsuspecting eastbound \nmotorists in the American plains states plunging over the edge of a sudden 4,000-mile-high \ncliff running between Central America and the North Pole, but gradually my attention did turn \nin a more scholarly manner to the scientific import of the drawing and the realization that the \nEarth consisted of discrete layers, ending in the center with a glowing sphere of iron and \nnickel, which was as hot as the surface of the Sun, according to the caption, and I remember \nthinking with real wonder: \"How do they know that?\" \n    I didn't doubt the correctness of the information for an instant-I still tend to trust the \npronouncements of scientists in the way I trust those of surgeons, plumbers, and other \npossessors of arcane and privileged information-but I couldn't for the life of me conceive howany human mind could work out what spaces thousands of miles below us, that no eye had \never seen and no X ray could penetrate, could look like and be made of. To me that was just a \nmiracle. That has been my position with science ever since. \n    Excited, I took the book home that night and opened it before dinner-an action that I expect \nprompted my mother to feel my forehead and ask if I was all right-and, starting with the first \npage, I read. \n    And here's the thing. It wasn't exciting at all. It wasn't actually altogether comprehensible. \nAbove all, it didn't answer any of the questions that the illustration stirred up in a normal \ninquiring mind: How did we end up with a Sun in the middle of our planet? And if it is \nburning away down there, why isn't the ground under our feet hot to the touch? And why isn't \nthe rest of the interior melting-or is it? And when the core at last burns itself out, will some of \nthe Earth slump into the void, leaving a giant sinkhole on the surface? And how do you know \nthis? How did you figure it out? \n    But the author was strangely silent on such details-indeed, silent on everything but \nanticlines, synclines, axial faults, and the like. It was as if he wanted to keep the good stuff \nsecret by making all of it soberly unfathomable. As the years passed, I began to suspect that \nthis was not altogether a private impulse. There seemed to be a mystifying universal \nconspiracy among textbook authors to make certain the material they dealt with never strayed \ntoo near the realm of the mildly interesting and was always at least a longdistance phone call \nfrom the frankly interesting. \n    I now know that there is a happy abundance of science writers who pen the most lucid and \nthrilling prose-Timothy Ferris, Richard Fortey, and Tim Flannery are three that jump out from \na single station of the alphabet (and that's not even to mention the late but godlike Richard \nFeynman)-but sadly none of them wrote any textbook I ever used. All mine were written by \nmen (it was always men) who held the interesting notion that everything became clear when \nexpressed as a formula and the amusingly deluded belief that the children of America would \nappreciate having chapters end with a section of questions they could mull over in their own \ntime. So I grew up convinced that science was supremely dull, but suspecting that it needn't \nbe, and not really thinking about it at all if I could help it. This, too, became my position for a \nlong time. \n    Then much later-about four or five years ago-I was on a long flight across the Pacific, \nstaring idly out the window at moonlit ocean, when it occurred to me with a certain \nuncomfortable forcefulness that I didn't know the first thing about the only planet I was ever \ngoing to live on. I had no idea, for example, why the oceans were salty but the Great Lakes \nweren't. Didn't have the faintest idea. I didn't know if the oceans were growing more salty \nwith time or less, and whether ocean salinity levels was something I should be concerned \nabout or not. (I am very pleased to tell you that until the late 1970s scientists didn't know the \nanswers to these questions either. They just didn't talk about it very audibly.) \n    And ocean salinity of course represented only the merest sliver of my ignorance. I didn't \nknow what a proton was, or a protein, didn't know a quark from a quasar, didn't understand \nhow geologists could look at a layer of rock on a canyon wall and tell you how old it was, \ndidn't know anything really. I became gripped by a quiet, unwonted urge to know a little \nabout these matters and to understand how people figured them out. That to me remained the \ngreatest of all amazements-how scientists work things out. How does anybody know how \nmuch the Earth weighs or how old its rocks are or what really is way down there in the \ncenter? How can they know how and when the universe started and what it was like when it \ndid? How do they know what goes on inside an atom? And how, come to that-or perhaps \nabove all-can scientists so often seem to know nearly everything but then still can't predict an \nearthquake or even tell us whether we should take an umbrella with us to the races next \nWednesday?So I decided that I would devote a portion of my life-three years, as it now turns out-to \nreading books and journals and finding saintly, patient experts prepared to answer a lot of \noutstandingly dumb questions. The idea was to see if it isn't possible to understand and \nappreciate-marvel at, enjoy even-the wonder and accomplishments of science at a level that \nisn't too technical or demanding, but isn't entirely superficial either. \n    That was my idea and my hope, and that is what the book that follows is intended to be. \nAnyway, we have a great deal of ground to cover and much less than 650,000 hours in which \nto do it, so let's begin.PART  I           LOST IN THE COSMOS \n \n \n \n \n \nThey\u2019re all in the same plane. \nThey\u2019re all going around in the \nsame direction. . . .

And it was all done in about the time it takes to make a sandwich.When this moment happened is a matter of some debate. Cosmologists have long argued \nover whether the moment of creation was 10 billion years ago or twice that or something in \nbetween. The consensus seems to be heading for a figure of about 13.7 billion years, but these \nthings are notoriously difficult to measure, as we shall see further on. All that can really be \nsaid is that at some indeterminate point in the very distant past, for reasons unknown, there \ncame the moment known to science as t = 0. We were on our way. \n    There is of course a great deal we don\u2019t know, and much of what we think we know we \nhaven\u2019t known, or thought we\u2019ve known, for long. Even the notion of the Big Bang is quite a \nrecent one. The idea had been kicking around since the 1920s, when Georges Lema\u00eetre, a \nBelgian priest-scholar, first tentatively proposed it, but it didn\u2019t really become an active \nnotion in cosmology until the mid-1960s when two young radio astronomers made an \nextraordinary and inadvertent discovery. \n    Their names were Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. In 1965, they were trying to make use \nof a large communications antenna owned by Bell Laboratories at Holmdel, New Jersey, but \nthey were troubled by a persistent background noise\u2014a steady, steamy hiss that made any \nexperimental work impossible. The noise was unrelenting and unfocused. It came from every \npoint in the sky, day and night, through every season. For a year the young astronomers did \neverything they could think of to track down and eliminate the noise. They tested every \nelectrical system. They rebuilt instruments, checked circuits, wiggled wires, dusted plugs. \nThey climbed into the dish and placed duct tape over every seam and rivet. They climbed \nback into the dish with brooms and scrubbing brushes and carefully swept it clean of what \nthey referred to in a later paper as \u201cwhite dielectric material,\u201d or what is known more \ncommonly as bird shit. Nothing they tried worked. \n    Unknown to them, just thirty miles away at Princeton University, a team of scientists led by \nRobert Dicke was working on how to find the very thing they were trying so diligently to get \nrid of. The Princeton researchers were pursuing an idea that had been suggested in the 1940s \nby the Russian-born astrophysicist George Gamow that if you looked deep enough into space \nyou should find some cosmic background radiation left over from the Big Bang. Gamow \ncalculated that by the time it crossed the vastness of the cosmos, the radiation would reach \nEarth in the form of microwaves. In a more recent paper he had even suggested an instrument \nthat might do the job: the Bell antenna at Holmdel. Unfortunately, neither Penzias and \nWilson, nor any of the Princeton team, had read Gamow\u2019s paper. \n    The noise that Penzias and Wilson were hearing was, of course, the noise that Gamow had \npostulated. They had found the edge of the universe, or at least the visible part of it, 90 billion \ntrillion miles away. They were \u201cseeing\u201d the first photons\u2014the most ancient light in the \nuniverse\u2014though time and distance had converted them to microwaves, just as Gamow had \npredicted. In his book The Inflationary Universe , Alan Guth provides an analogy that helps to \nput this finding in perspective. If you think of peering into the depths of the universe as like \nlooking down from the hundredth floor of the Empire State Building (with the hundredth floor \nrepresenting now and street level representing the moment of the Big Bang), at the time of \nWilson and Penzias\u2019s discovery the most distant galaxies anyone had ever detected were on \nabout the sixtieth floor, and the most distant things\u2014quasars\u2014were on about the twentieth. \nPenzias and Wilson\u2019s finding pushed our acquaintance with the visible universe to within half \nan inch of the sidewalk. \n    Still unaware of what caused the noise, Wilson and Penzias phoned Dicke at Princeton and \ndescribed their problem to him in the hope that he might suggest a solution. Dicke realized atonce what the two young men had found. \u201cWell, boys, we\u2019ve just been scooped,\u201d he told his \ncolleagues as he hung up the phone. \n    Soon afterward the Astrophysical Journal published two articles: one by Penzias and \nWilson describing their experience with the hiss, the other by Dicke\u2019s team explaining its \nnature. Although Penzias and Wilson had not been looking for cosmic background radiation, \ndidn\u2019t know what it was when they had found it, and hadn\u2019t described or interpreted its \ncharacter in any paper, they received the 1978 Nobel Prize in physics. The Princeton \nresearchers got only sympathy. According to Dennis Overbye in Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos \n, neither Penzias nor Wilson altogether understood the significance of what they had found \nuntil they read about it in the New York Times . \n    Incidentally, disturbance from cosmic background radiation is something we have all \nexperienced. Tune your television to any channel it doesn\u2019t receive, and about 1 percent of the \ndancing static you see is accounted for by this ancient remnant of the Big Bang. The next time \nyou complain that there is nothing on, remember that you can always watch the birth of the \nuniverse. \n    Although everyone calls it the Big Bang, many books caution us not to think of it as an \nexplosion in the conventional sense. It was, rather, a vast, sudden expansion on a whopping \nscale. So what caused it? \n   One notion is that perhaps the singularity was the relic of an earlier, collapsed universe\u2014\nthat we\u2019re just one of an eternal cycle of expanding and collapsing universes, like the bladder \non an oxygen machine. Others attribute the Big Bang to what they call \u201ca false vacuum\u201d or \u201ca \nscalar field\u201d or \u201cvacuum energy\u201d\u2014some quality or thing, at any rate, that introduced a \nmeasure of instability into the nothingness that was. It seems impossible that you could get \nsomething from nothing, but the fact that once there was nothing and now there is a universe \nis evident proof that you can. It may be that our universe is merely part of many larger \nuniverses, some in different dimensions, and that Big Bangs are going on all the time all over \nthe place. Or it may be that space and time had some other forms altogether before the Big \nBang\u2014forms too alien for us to imagine\u2014and that the Big Bang represents some sort of \ntransition phase, where the universe went from a form we can\u2019t understand to one we almost \ncan. \u201cThese are very close to religious questions,\u201d Dr. Andrei Linde, a cosmologist at \nStanford, told the New York Times in 2001. \n    The Big Bang theory isn\u2019t about the bang itself but about what happened after the bang. \nNot long after, mind you. By doing a lot of math and watching carefully what goes on in \nparticle accelerators, scientists believe they can look back to 10-43seconds after the moment of \ncreation, when the universe was still so small that you would have needed a microscope to \nfind it. We mustn\u2019t swoon over every extraordinary number that comes before us, but it is \nperhaps worth latching on to one from time to time just to be reminded of their ungraspable \nand amazing breadth. Thus 10-43is 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000001, or \none 10 million trillion trillion trillionths of a second.* \n                                                 \n*A word on scientific notation: Since very large numbers are cumbersome to write and nearly impossible to read, scientists \nuse a shorthand involving powers (or multiples) of ten in which, for instance, 10,000,000,000 is written 1010 and 6,500,000 \nbecomes 6.5 x 106. The principle is based very simply on multiples of ten: 10 x 10 (or 100) becomes 102; 10 x 10 x 10 (or \n1,000) is 103; and so on, obviously and indefinitely. The little superscript number signifies the number of zeroes following \nthe larger principal number. Negative notations provide latter in print (especially essentially a mirror image, with the \nsuperscript number indicating the number of spaces to the right of the decimal point (so 10-4 means 0.0001). Though I salute \nthe principle, it remains an amazement to me that anyone seeing \"1.4 x 109 km3\u2019 would see at once that that signifies 1.4Most of what we know, or believe we know, about the early moments of the universe is \nthanks to an idea called inflation theory first propounded in 1979 by a junior particle \nphysicist, then at Stanford, now at MIT, named Alan Guth. He was thirty-two years old and, \nby his own admission, had never done anything much before. He would probably never have \nhad his great theory except that he happened to attend a lecture on the Big Bang given by \nnone other than Robert Dicke. The lecture inspired Guth to take an interest in cosmology, and \nin particular in the birth of the universe. \n    The eventual result was the inflation theory, which holds that a fraction of a moment after \nthe dawn of creation, the universe underwent a sudden dramatic expansion. It inflated\u2014in \neffect ran away with itself, doubling in size every 10-34seconds. The whole episode may have \nlasted no more than 10-30seconds\u2014that\u2019s one million million million million millionths of a \nsecond\u2014but it changed the universe from something you could hold in your hand to \nsomething at least 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times bigger. Inflation theory \nexplains the ripples and eddies that make our universe possible. Without it, there would be no \nclumps of matter and thus no stars, just drifting gas and everlasting darkness. \n    According to Guth\u2019s theory, at one ten-millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth \nof a second, gravity emerged. After another ludicrously brief interval it was joined by \nelectromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces\u2014the stuff of physics. These were \njoined an instant later by swarms of elementary particles\u2014the stuff of stuff. From nothing at \nall, suddenly there were swarms of photons, protons, electrons, neutrons, and much else\u2014\nbetween 1079and 1089of each, according to the standard Big Bang theory. \n    Such quantities are of course ungraspable. It is enough to know that in a single cracking \ninstant we were endowed with a universe that was vast\u2014at least a hundred billion light-years \nacross, according to the theory, but possibly any size up to infinite\u2014and perfectly arrayed for \nthe creation of stars, galaxies, and other complex systems. \n  \n    What is extraordinary from our point of view is how well it turned out for us. If the \nuniverse had formed just a tiny bit differently\u2014if gravity were fractionally stronger or \nweaker, if the expansion had proceeded just a little more slowly or swiftly\u2014then there might \nnever have been stable elements to make you and me and the ground we stand on. Had gravity \nbeen a trifle stronger, the universe itself might have collapsed like a badly erected tent, \nwithout precisely the right values to give it the right dimensions and density and component \nparts. Had it been weaker, however, nothing would have coalesced. The universe would have \nremained forever a dull, scattered void. \n    This is one reason that some experts believe there may have been many other big bangs, \nperhaps trillions and trillions of them, spread through the mighty span of eternity, and that the \nreason we exist in this particular one is that this is one we could exist in. As Edward P. Tryon \nof Columbia University once put it: \u201cIn answer to the question of why it happened, I offer the \nmodest proposal that our Universe is simply one of those things which happen from time to \n                                                                                                                                                        \n \nbillion cubic kilometers, and no less a wonder that they would choose the former over the in a book designed for the general \nreader, where the example was found). On the assumption that many general readers are as unmathematical as I am, I will use \nthem sparingly, though they are occasionally unavoidable, not least in a chapter dealing with things on a cosmic scale.time.\u201d To which adds Guth: \u201cAlthough the creation of a universe might be very unlikely, \nTryon emphasized that no one had counted the failed attempts.\u201d \n \n \n    Martin Rees, Britain\u2019s astronomer royal, believes that there are many universes, possibly an \ninfinite number, each with different attributes, in different combinations, and that we simply \nlive in one that combines things in the way that allows us to exist. He makes an analogy with \na very large clothing store: \u201cIf there is a large stock of clothing, you\u2019re not surprised to find a \nsuit that fits. If there are many universes, each governed by a differing set of numbers, there \nwill be one where there is a particular set of numbers suitable to life. We are in that one.\u201d \n    Rees maintains that six numbers in particular govern our universe, and that if any of these \nvalues were changed even very slightly things could not be as they are. For example, for the \nuniverse to exist as it does requires that hydrogen be converted to helium in a precise but \ncomparatively stately manner\u2014specifically, in a way that converts seven one-thousandths of \nits mass to energy. Lower that value very slightly\u2014from 0.007 percent to 0.006 percent, \nsay\u2014and no transformation could take place: the universe would consist of hydrogen and \nnothing else. Raise the value very slightly\u2014to 0.008 percent\u2014and bonding would be so \nwildly prolific that the hydrogen would long since have been exhausted. In either case, with \nthe slightest tweaking of the numbers the universe as we know and need it would not be here. \n  \nI should say that everything is just right so far. In the long term, gravity may turn out to be a \nlittle too strong, and one day it may halt the expansion of the universe and bring it collapsing \nin upon itself, till it crushes itself down into another singularity, possibly to start the whole \nprocess over again. On the other hand it may be too weak and the universe will keep racing \naway forever until everything is so far apart that there is no chance of material interactions, so \nthat the universe becomes a place that is inert and dead, but very roomy. The third option is \nthat gravity is just right\u2014\u201ccritical density\u201d is the cosmologists\u2019 term for it\u2014and that it will \nhold the universe together at just the right dimensions to allow things to go on indefinitely. \nCosmologists in their lighter moments sometimes call this the Goldilocks effect\u2014that \neverything is just right. (For the record, these three possible universes are known respectively \nas closed, open, and flat.) \n    Now the question that has occurred to all of us at some point is: what would happen if you \ntraveled out to the edge of the universe and, as it were, put your head through the curtains? \nWhere would your head be if it were no longer in the universe? What would you find beyond? \nThe answer, disappointingly, is that you can never get to the edge of the universe. That\u2019s not \nbecause it would take too long to get there\u2014though of course it would\u2014but because even if \nyou traveled outward and outward in a straight line, indefinitely and pugnaciously, you would \nnever arrive at an outer boundary. Instead, you would come back to where you began (at \nwhich point, presumably, you would rather lose heart in the exercise and give up). The reason \nfor this is that the universe bends, in a way we can\u2019t adequately imagine, in conformance with \nEinstein\u2019s theory of relativity (which we will get to in due course). For the moment it is \nenough to know that we are not adrift in some large, ever-expanding bubble. Rather, space \ncurves, in a way that allows it to be boundless but finite. Space cannot even properly be said \nto be expanding because, as the physicist and Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg notes, \u201csolarsystems and galaxies are not expanding, and space itself is not expanding.\u201d Rather, the \ngalaxies are rushing apart. It is all something of a challenge to intuition. Or as the biologist J. \nB. S. Haldane once famously observed: \u201cThe universe is not only queerer than we suppose; it \nis queerer than we can suppose.\u201d \n    The analogy that is usually given for explaining the curvature of space is to try to imagine \nsomeone from a universe of flat surfaces, who had never seen a sphere, being brought to \nEarth. No matter how far he roamed across the planet\u2019s surface, he would never find an edge. \nHe might eventually return to the spot where he had started, and would of course be utterly \nconfounded to explain how that had happened. Well, we are in the same position in space as \nour puzzled flatlander, only we are flummoxed by a higher dimension. \n    Just as there is no place where you can find the edge of the universe, so there is no place \nwhere you can stand at the center and say: \u201cThis is where it all began. This is the centermost \npoint of it all.\u201d We are all at the center of it all. Actually, we don\u2019t know that for sure; we \ncan\u2019t prove it mathematically. Scientists just assume that we can\u2019t really be the center of the \nuniverse\u2014think what that would imply\u2014but that the phenomenon must be the same for all \nobservers in all places. Still, we don\u2019t actually know. \n    For us, the universe goes only as far as light has traveled in the billions of years since the \nuniverse was formed. This visible universe\u2014the universe we know and can talk about\u2014is a \nmillion million million million (that\u2019s 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) miles across. But \naccording to most theories the universe at large\u2014the meta-universe, as it is sometimes \ncalled\u2014is vastly roomier still. According to Rees, the number of light-years to the edge of \nthis larger, unseen universe would be written not \u201cwith ten zeroes, not even with a hundred, \nbut with millions.\u201d In short, there\u2019s more space than you can imagine already without going to \nthe trouble of trying to envision some additional beyond. \n    For a long time the Big Bang theory had one gaping hole that troubled a lot of people\u2014\nnamely that it couldn\u2019t begin to explain how we got here. Although 98 percent of all the \nmatter that exists was created with the Big Bang, that matter consisted exclusively of light \ngases: the helium, hydrogen, and lithium that we mentioned earlier. Not one particle of the \nheavy stuff so vital to our own being\u2014carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and all the rest\u2014emerged \nfrom the gaseous brew of creation. But\u2014and here\u2019s the troubling point\u2014to forge these heavy \nelements, you need the kind of heat and energy of a Big Bang. Yet there has been only one \nBig Bang and it didn\u2019t produce them. So where did they come from? \n    Interestingly, the man who found the answer to that question was a cosmologist who \nheartily despised the Big Bang as a theory and coined the term \u201cBig Bang\u201d sarcastically, as a \nway of mocking it. We\u2019ll get to him shortly, but before we turn to the question of how we got \nhere, it might be worth taking a few minutes to consider just where exactly \u201chere\u201d is.", "2": "2  WELCOME TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM \nASTRONOMERS THESE DAYS can do the most amazing things. If someone struck a match \non the Moon, they could spot the flare. From the tiniest throbs and wobbles of distant stars \nthey can infer the size and character and even potential habitability of planets much too \nremote to be seen\u2014planets so distant that it would take us half a million years in a spaceship \nto get there. With their radio telescopes they can capture wisps of radiation so preposterously \nfaint that the total amount of energy collected from outside the solar system by all of them \ntogether since collecting began (in 1951) is \u201cless than the energy of a single snowflake \nstriking the ground,\u201d in the words of Carl Sagan. \n    In short, there isn\u2019t a great deal that goes on in the universe that astronomers can\u2019t find \nwhen they have a mind to. Which is why it is all the more remarkable to reflect that until 1978 \nno one had ever noticed that Pluto has a moon. In the summer of that year, a young \nastronomer named James Christy at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, was \nmaking a routine examination of photographic images of Pluto when he saw that there was \nsomething there\u2014something blurry and uncertain but definitely other than Pluto. Consulting a \ncolleague named Robert Harrington, he concluded that what he was looking at was a moon. \nAnd it wasn\u2019t just any moon. Relative to the planet, it was the biggest moon in the solar \nsystem. \n    This was actually something of a blow to Pluto\u2019s status as a planet, which had never been \nterribly robust anyway. Since previously the space occupied by the moon and the space \noccupied by Pluto were thought to be one and the same, it meant that Pluto was much smaller \nthan anyone had supposed\u2014smaller even than Mercury. Indeed, seven moons in the solar \nsystem, including our own, are larger. \n    Now a natural question is why it took so long for anyone to find a moon in our own solar \nsystem. The answer is that it is partly a matter of where astronomers point their instruments \nand partly a matter of what their instruments are designed to detect, and partly it\u2019s just Pluto. \nMostly it\u2019s where they point their instruments. In the words of the astronomer Clark \nChapman: \u201cMost people think that astronomers get out at night in observatories and scan the \nskies. That\u2019s not true. Almost all the telescopes we have in the world are designed to peer at \nvery tiny little pieces of the sky way off in the distance to see a quasar or hunt for black holes \nor look at a distant galaxy. The only real network of telescopes that scans the skies has been \ndesigned and built by the military.\u201d \n    We have been spoiled by artists\u2019 renderings into imagining a clarity of resolution that \ndoesn\u2019t exist in actual astronomy. Pluto in Christy\u2019s photograph is faint and fuzzy\u2014a piece of \ncosmic lint\u2014and its moon is not the romantically backlit, crisply delineated companion orb \nyou would get in a National Geographic painting, but rather just a tiny and extremely \nindistinct hint of additional fuzziness. Such was the fuzziness, in fact, that it took seven years \nfor anyone to spot the moon again and thus independently confirm its existence. \n    One nice touch about Christy\u2019s discovery was that it happened in Flagstaff, for it was there \nin 1930 that Pluto had been found in the first place. That seminal event in astronomy was \nlargely to the credit of the astronomer Percival Lowell. Lowell, who came from one of the \noldest and wealthiest Boston families (the one in the famous ditty about Boston being the \nhome of the bean and the cod, where Lowells spoke only to Cabots, while Cabots spoke only \nto God), endowed the famous observatory that bears his name, but is most indelibly \nremembered for his belief that Mars was covered with canals built by industrious Martians forpurposes of conveying water from polar regions to the dry but productive lands nearer the \nequator. \n    Lowell\u2019s other abiding conviction was that there existed, somewhere out beyond Neptune, \nan undiscovered ninth planet, dubbed Planet X. Lowell based this belief on irregularities he \ndetected in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, and devoted the last years of his life to trying to \nfind the gassy giant he was certain was out there. Unfortunately, he died suddenly in 1916, at \nleast partly exhausted by his quest, and the search fell into abeyance while Lowell\u2019s heirs \nsquabbled over his estate. However, in 1929, partly as a way of deflecting attention away \nfrom the Mars canal saga (which by now had become a serious embarrassment), the Lowell \nObservatory directors decided to resume the search and to that end hired a young man from \nKansas named Clyde Tombaugh. \n    Tombaugh had no formal training as an astronomer, but he was diligent and he was astute, \nand after a year\u2019s patient searching he somehow spotted Pluto, a faint point of light in a \nglittery firmament. It was a miraculous find, and what made it all the more striking was that \nthe observations on which Lowell had predicted the existence of a planet beyond Neptune \nproved to be comprehensively erroneous. Tombaugh could see at once that the new planet \nwas nothing like the massive gasball Lowell had postulated, but any reservations he or anyone \nelse had about the character of the new planet were soon swept aside in the delirium that \nattended almost any big news story in that easily excited age. This was the first American-\ndiscovered planet, and no one was going to be distracted by the thought that it was really just \na distant icy dot. It was named Pluto at least partly because the first two letters made a \nmonogram from Lowell\u2019s initials. Lowell was posthumously hailed everywhere as a genius of \nthe first order, and Tombaugh was largely forgotten, except among planetary astronomers, \nwho tend to revere him. \n    A few astronomers continue to think there may be a Planet X out there\u2014a real whopper, \nperhaps as much as ten times the size of Jupiter, but so far out as to be invisible to us. (It \nwould receive so little sunlight that it would have almost none to reflect.) The idea is that it \nwouldn\u2019t be a conventional planet like Jupiter or Saturn\u2014it\u2019s much too far away for that; \nwe\u2019re talking perhaps 4.5 trillion miles\u2014but more like a sun that never quite made it. Most \nstar systems in the cosmos are binary (double-starred), which makes our solitary sun a slight \noddity. \n    As for Pluto itself, nobody is quite sure how big it is, or what it is made of, what kind of \natmosphere it has, or even what it really is. A lot of astronomers believe it isn\u2019t a planet at all, \nbut merely the largest object so far found in a zone of galactic debris known as the Kuiper \nbelt. The Kuiper belt was actually theorized by an astronomer named F. C. Leonard in 1930, \nbut the name honors Gerard Kuiper, a Dutch native working in America, who expanded the \nidea. The Kuiper belt is the source of what are known as short-period comets\u2014those that \ncome past pretty regularly\u2014of which the most famous is Halley\u2019s comet. The more reclusive \nlong-period comets (among them the recent visitors Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake) come from \nthe much more distant Oort cloud, about which more presently. \n    It is certainly true that Pluto doesn\u2019t act much like the other planets. Not only is it runty and \nobscure, but it is so variable in its motions that no one can tell you exactly where Pluto will be \na century hence. Whereas the other planets orbit on more or less the same plane, Pluto\u2019s \norbital path is tipped (as it were) out of alignment at an angle of seventeen degrees, like the \nbrim of a hat tilted rakishly on someone\u2019s head. Its orbit is so irregular that for substantial \nperiods on each of its lonely circuits around the Sun it is closer to us than Neptune is. Formost of the 1980s and 1990s, Neptune was in fact the solar system\u2019s most far-flung planet. \nOnly on February 11, 1999, did Pluto return to the outside lane, there to remain for the next \n228 years. \n    So if Pluto really is a planet, it is certainly an odd one. It is very tiny: just one-quarter of 1 \npercent as massive as Earth. If you set it down on top of the United States, it would cover not \nquite half the lower forty-eight states. This alone makes it extremely anomalous; it means that \nour planetary system consists of four rocky inner planets, four gassy outer giants, and a tiny, \nsolitary iceball. Moreover, there is every reason to suppose that we may soon begin to find \nother even larger icy spheres in the same portion of space. Then we will have problems. After \nChristy spotted Pluto\u2019s moon, astronomers began to regard that section of the cosmos more \nattentively and as of early December 2002 had found over six hundred additional Trans-\nNeptunian Objects, or Plutinos as they are alternatively called. One, dubbed Varuna, is nearly \nas big as Pluto\u2019s moon. Astronomers now think there may be billions of these objects. The \ndifficulty is that many of them are awfully dark. Typically they have an albedo, or \nreflectiveness, of just 4 percent, about the same as a lump of charcoal\u2014and of course these \nlumps of charcoal are about four billion miles away. \n  \n    And how far is that exactly? It\u2019s almost beyond imagining. Space, you see, is just \nenormous\u2014just enormous. Let\u2019s imagine, for purposes of edification and entertainment, that \nwe are about to go on a journey by rocketship. We won\u2019t go terribly far\u2014just to the edge of \nour own solar system\u2014but we need to get a fix on how big a place space is and what a small \npart of it we occupy. \n    Now the bad news, I\u2019m afraid, is that we won\u2019t be home for supper. Even at the speed of \nlight, it would take seven hours to get to Pluto. But of course we can\u2019t travel at anything like \nthat speed. We\u2019ll have to go at the speed of a spaceship, and these are rather more lumbering. \nThe best speeds yet achieved by any human object are those of the Voyager 1 and2 spacecraft, \nwhich are now flying away from us at about thirty-five thousand miles an hour. \n    The reason the Voyager craft were launched when they were (in August and September \n1977) was that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune were aligned in a way that happens only \nonce every 175 years. This enabled the two Voyagers to use a \u201cgravity assist\u201d technique in \nwhich the craft were successively flung from one gassy giant to the next in a kind of cosmic \nversion of \u201ccrack the whip.\u201d Even so, it took them nine years to reach Uranus and a dozen to \ncross the orbit of Pluto. The good news is that if we wait until January 2006 (which is when \nNASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft is tentatively scheduled to depart for Pluto) we can take \nadvantage of favorable Jovian positioning, plus some advances in technology, and get there in \nonly a decade or so\u2014though getting home again will take rather longer, I\u2019m afraid. At all \nevents, it\u2019s going to be a long trip. \n    Now the first thing you are likely to realize is that space is extremely well named and rather \ndismayingly uneventful. Our solar system may be the liveliest thing for trillions of miles, but \nall the visible stuff in it\u2014the Sun, the planets and their moons, the billion or so tumbling \nrocks of the asteroid belt, comets, and other miscellaneous drifting detritus\u2014fills less than a \ntrillionth of the available space. You also quickly realize that none of the maps you have ever \nseen of the solar system were remotely drawn to scale. Most schoolroom charts show the \nplanets coming one after the other at neighborly intervals\u2014the outer giants actually cast \nshadows over each other in many illustrations\u2014but this is a necessary deceit to get them allon the same piece of paper. Neptune in reality isn\u2019t just a little bit beyond Jupiter, it\u2019s way \nbeyond Jupiter\u2014five times farther from Jupiter than Jupiter is from us, so far out that it \nreceives only 3 percent as much sunlight as Jupiter. \n    Such are the distances, in fact, that it isn\u2019t possible, in any practical terms, to draw the solar \nsystem to scale. Even if you added lots of fold-out pages to your textbooks or used a really \nlong sheet of poster paper, you wouldn\u2019t come close. On a diagram of the solar system to \nscale, with Earth reduced to about the diameter of a pea, Jupiter would be over a thousand feet \naway and Pluto would be a mile and a half distant (and about the size of a bacterium, so you \nwouldn\u2019t be able to see it anyway). On the same scale, Proxima Centauri, our nearest star, \nwould be almost ten thousand miles away. Even if you shrank down everything so that Jupiter \nwas as small as the period at the end of this sentence, and Pluto was no bigger than a \nmolecule, Pluto would still be over thirty-five feet away. \n    So the solar system is really quite enormous. By the time we reach Pluto, we have come so \nfar that the Sun\u2014our dear, warm, skin-tanning, life-giving Sun\u2014has shrunk to the size of a \npinhead. It is little more than a bright star. In such a lonely void you can begin to understand \nhow even the most significant objects\u2014Pluto\u2019s moon, for example\u2014have escaped attention. \nIn this respect, Pluto has hardly been alone. Until the Voyager expeditions, Neptune was \nthought to have two moons; Voyager found six more. When I was a boy, the solar system was \nthought to contain thirty moons. The total now is \u201cat least ninety,\u201d about a third of which have \nbeen found in just the last ten years. \n    The point to remember, of course, is that when considering the universe at large we don\u2019t \nactually know what is in our own solar system. \n    Now the other thing you will notice as we speed past Pluto is that we are speeding past \nPluto. If you check your itinerary, you will see that this is a trip to the edge of our solar \nsystem, and I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re not there yet. Pluto may be the last object marked on \nschoolroom charts, but the system doesn\u2019t end there. In fact, it isn\u2019t even close to ending \nthere. We won\u2019t get to the solar system\u2019s edge until we have passed through the Oort cloud, a \nvast celestial realm of drifting comets, and we won\u2019t reach the Oort cloud for another\u2014I\u2019m so \nsorry about this\u2014ten thousand years. Far from marking the outer edge of the solar system, as \nthose schoolroom maps so cavalierly imply, Pluto is barely one-fifty-thousandth of the way. \n    Of course we have no prospect of such a journey. A trip of 240,000 miles to the Moon still \nrepresents a very big undertaking for us. A manned mission to Mars, called for by the first \nPresident Bush in a moment of passing giddiness, was quietly dropped when someone worked \nout that it would cost $450 billion and probably result in the deaths of all the crew (their DNA \ntorn to tatters by high-energy solar particles from which they could not be shielded). \n    Based on what we know now and can reasonably imagine, there is absolutely no prospect \nthat any human being will ever visit the edge of our own solar system\u2014ever. It is just too far. \nAs it is, even with the Hubble telescope, we can\u2019t see even into the Oort cloud, so we don\u2019t \nactually know that it is there. Its existence is probable but entirely hypothetical.* \n    About all that can be said with confidence about the Oort cloud is that it starts somewhere \nbeyond Pluto and stretches some two light-years out into the cosmos. The basic unit of \nmeasure in the solar system is the Astronomical Unit, or AU, representing the distance from \n                                                 \n* Properly called the Opik-Oort cloud, it is named for the Estonian astronomer Ernst Opik, who hypothesized its \nexistence in 1932, and for the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who refined the calculations eighteen years later.the Sun to the Earth. Pluto is about forty AUs from us, the heart of the Oort cloud about fifty \nthousand. In a word, it is remote. \n    But let\u2019s pretend again that we have made it to the Oort cloud. The first thing you might \nnotice is how very peaceful it is out here. We\u2019re a long way from anywhere now\u2014so far from \nour own Sun that it\u2019s not even the brightest star in the sky. It is a remarkable thought that that \ndistant tiny twinkle has enough gravity to hold all these comets in orbit. It\u2019s not a very strong \nbond, so the comets drift in a stately manner, moving at only about 220 miles an hour. From \ntime to time some of these lonely comets are nudged out of their normal orbit by some slight \ngravitational perturbation\u2014a passing star perhaps. Sometimes they are ejected into the \nemptiness of space, never to be seen again, but sometimes they fall into a long orbit around \nthe Sun. About three or four of these a year, known as long-period comets, pass through the \ninner solar system. Just occasionally these stray visitors smack into something solid, like \nEarth. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve come out here now\u2014because the comet we have come to see has \njust begun a long fall toward the center of the solar system. It is headed for, of all places, \nManson, Iowa. It is going to take a long time to get there\u2014three or four million years at \nleast\u2014so we\u2019ll leave it for now, and return to it much later in the story. \n  \n    So that\u2019s your solar system. And what else is out there, beyond the solar system? Well, \nnothing and a great deal, depending on how you look at it. \n    In the short term, it\u2019s nothing. The most perfect vacuum ever created by humans is not as \nempty as the emptiness of interstellar space. And there is a great deal of this nothingness until \nyou get to the next bit of something. Our nearest neighbor in the cosmos, Proxima Centauri, \nwhich is part of the three-star cluster known as Alpha Centauri, is 4.3 light-years away, a sissy \nskip in galactic terms, but that is still a hundred million times farther than a trip to the Moon. \nTo reach it by spaceship would take at least twenty-five thousand years, and even if you made \nthe trip you still wouldn\u2019t be anywhere except at a lonely clutch of stars in the middle of a \nvast nowhere. To reach the next landmark of consequence, Sirius, would involve another 4.6 \nlight-years of travel. And so it would go if you tried to star-hop your way across the cosmos. \nJust reaching the center of our own galaxy would take far longer than we have existed as \nbeings. \n    Space, let me repeat, is enormous. The average distance between stars out there is 20 \nmillion million miles. Even at speeds approaching those of light, these are fantastically \nchallenging distances for any traveling individual. Of course, it is possible that alien beings \ntravel billions of miles to amuse themselves by planting crop circles in Wiltshire or \nfrightening the daylights out of some poor guy in a pickup truck on a lonely road in Arizona \n(they must have teenagers, after all), but it does seem unlikely. \n    Still, statistically the probability that there are other thinking beings out there is good. \nNobody knows how many stars there are in the Milky Way\u2014estimates range from 100 billion \nor so to perhaps 400 billion\u2014and the Milky Way is just one of 140 billion or so other \ngalaxies, many of them even larger than ours. In the 1960s, a professor at Cornell named \nFrank Drake, excited by such whopping numbers, worked out a famous equation designed to \ncalculate the chances of advanced life in the cosmos based on a series of diminishing \nprobabilities.Under Drake\u2019s equation you divide the number of stars in a selected portion of the universe \nby the number of stars that are likely to have planetary systems; divide that by the number of \nplanetary systems that could theoretically support life; divide that by the number on which \nlife, having arisen, advances to a state of intelligence; and so on. At each such division, the \nnumber shrinks colossally\u2014yet even with the most conservative inputs the number of \nadvanced civilizations just in the Milky Way always works out to be somewhere in the \nmillions. \n    What an interesting and exciting thought. We may be only one of millions of advanced \ncivilizations. Unfortunately, space being spacious, the average distance between any two of \nthese civilizations is reckoned to be at least two hundred light-years, which is a great deal \nmore than merely saying it makes it sound. It means for a start that even if these beings know \nwe are here and are somehow able to see us in their telescopes, they\u2019re watching light that left \nEarth two hundred years ago. So they\u2019re not seeing you and me. They\u2019re watching the French \nRevolution and Thomas Jefferson and people in silk stockings and powdered wigs\u2014people \nwho don\u2019t know what an atom is, or a gene, and who make their electricity by rubbing a rod \nof amber with a piece of fur and think that\u2019s quite a trick. Any message we receive from them \nis likely to begin \u201cDear Sire,\u201d and congratulate us on the handsomeness of our horses and our \nmastery of whale oil. Two hundred light-years is a distance so far beyond us as to be, well, \njust beyond us. \n    So even if we are not really alone, in all practical terms we are. Carl Sagan calculated the \nnumber of probable planets in the universe at large at 10 billion trillion\u2014a number vastly \nbeyond imagining. But what is equally beyond imagining is the amount of space through \nwhich they are lightly scattered. \u201cIf we were randomly inserted into the universe,\u201d Sagan \nwrote, \u201cthe chances that you would be on or near a planet would be less than one in a billion \ntrillion trillion.\u201d (That\u2019s 1033, or a one followed by thirty-three zeroes.) \u201cWorlds are precious.\u201d \n    Which is why perhaps it is good news that in February 1999 the International Astronomical \nUnion ruled officially that Pluto is a planet. The universe is a big and lonely place. We can do \nwith all the neighbors we can get.", "3": "3  THE REVEREND EVANS\u2019S UNIVERSE \nWHEN THE SKIES are clear and the Moon is not too bright, the Reverend Robert Evans, a \nquiet and cheerful man, lugs a bulky telescope onto the back deck of his home in the Blue \nMountains of Australia, about fifty miles west of Sydney, and does an extraordinary thing. He \nlooks deep into the past and finds dying stars. \n    Looking into the past is of course the easy part. Glance at the night sky and what you see is \nhistory and lots of it\u2014the stars not as they are now but as they were when their light left \nthem. For all we know, the North Star, our faithful companion, might actually have burned \nout last January or in 1854 or at any time since the early fourteenth century and news of it just \nhasn\u2019t reached us yet. The best we can say\u2014can ever say\u2014is that it was still burning on this \ndate 680 years ago. Stars die all the time. What Bob Evans does better than anyone else who \nhas ever tried is spot these moments of celestial farewell. \n    By day, Evans is a kindly and now semiretired minister in the Uniting Church in Australia, \nwho does a bit of freelance work and researches the history of nineteenth-century religious \nmovements. But by night he is, in his unassuming way, a titan of the skies. He hunts \nsupernovae. \n    Supernovae occur when a giant star, one much bigger than our own Sun, collapses and then \nspectacularly explodes, releasing in an instant the energy of a hundred billion suns, burning \nfor a time brighter than all the stars in its galaxy. \u201cIt\u2019s like a trillion hydrogen bombs going off \nat once,\u201d says Evans. If a supernova explosion happened within five hundred light-years of us, \nwe would be goners, according to Evans\u2014\u201cit would wreck the show,\u201d as he cheerfully puts it. \nBut the universe is vast, and supernovae are normally much too far away to harm us. In fact, \nmost are so unimaginably distant that their light reaches us as no more than the faintest \ntwinkle. For the month or so that they are visible, all that distinguishes them from the other \nstars in the sky is that they occupy a point of space that wasn\u2019t filled before. It is these \nanomalous, very occasional pricks in the crowded dome of the night sky that the Reverend \nEvans finds. \n    To understand what a feat this is, imagine a standard dining room table covered in a black \ntablecloth and someone throwing a handful of salt across it. The scattered grains can be \nthought of as a galaxy. Now imagine fifteen hundred more tables like the first one\u2014enough to \nfill a Wal-Mart parking lot, say, or to make a single line two miles long\u2014each with a random \narray of salt across it. Now add one grain of salt to any table and let Bob Evans walk among \nthem. At a glance he will spot it. That grain of salt is the supernova. \n    Evans\u2019s is a talent so exceptional that Oliver Sacks, in An Anthropologist on Mars, devotes \na passage to him in a chapter on autistic savants\u2014quickly adding that \u201cthere is no suggestion \nthat he is autistic.\u201d Evans, who has not met Sacks, laughs at the suggestion that he might be \neither autistic or a savant, but he is powerless to explain quite where his talent comes from. \n    \u201cI just seem to have a knack for memorizing star fields,\u201d he told me, with a frankly \napologetic look, when I visited him and his wife, Elaine, in their picture-book bungalow on a \ntranquil edge of the village of Hazelbrook, out where Sydney finally ends and the boundless \nAustralian bush begins. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly good at other things,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t \nremember names well.\u201d \n    \u201cOr where he\u2019s put things,\u201d called Elaine from the kitchen.He nodded frankly again and grinned, then asked me if I\u2019d like to see his telescope. I had \nimagined that Evans would have a proper observatory in his backyard\u2014a scaled-down \nversion of a Mount Wilson or Palomar, with a sliding domed roof and a mechanized chair that \nwould be a pleasure to maneuver. In fact, he led me not outside but to a crowded storeroom \noff the kitchen where he keeps his books and papers and where his telescope\u2014a white \ncylinder that is about the size and shape of a household hot-water tank\u2014rests in a homemade, \nswiveling plywood mount. When he wishes to observe, he carries them in two trips to a small \ndeck off the kitchen. Between the overhang of the roof and the feathery tops of eucalyptus \ntrees growing up from the slope below, he has only a letter-box view of the sky, but he says it \nis more than good enough for his purposes. And there, when the skies are clear and the Moon \nnot too bright, he finds his supernovae. \n  \n    The term supernova was coined in the 1930s by a memorably odd astrophysicist named \nFritz Zwicky. Born in Bulgaria and raised in Switzerland, Zwicky came to the California \nInstitute of Technology in the 1920s and there at once distinguished himself by his abrasive \npersonality and erratic talents. He didn\u2019t seem to be outstandingly bright, and many of his \ncolleagues considered him little more than \u201can irritating buffoon.\u201d A fitness buff, he would \noften drop to the floor of the Caltech dining hall or other public areas and do one-armed \npushups to demonstrate his virility to anyone who seemed inclined to doubt it. He was \nnotoriously aggressive, his manner eventually becoming so intimidating that his closest \ncollaborator, a gentle man named Walter Baade, refused to be left alone with him. Among \nother things, Zwicky accused Baade, who was German, of being a Nazi, which he was not. On \nat least one occasion Zwicky threatened to kill Baade, who worked up the hill at the Mount \nWilson Observatory, if he saw him on the Caltech campus. \n    But Zwicky was also capable of insights of the most startling brilliance. In the early 1930s, \nhe turned his attention to a question that had long troubled astronomers: the appearance in the \nsky of occasional unexplained points of light, new stars. Improbably he wondered if the \nneutron\u2014the subatomic particle that had just been discovered in England by James \nChadwick, and was thus both novel and rather fashionable\u2014might be at the heart of things. It \noccurred to him that if a star collapsed to the sort of densities found in the core of atoms, the \nresult would be an unimaginably compacted core. Atoms would literally be crushed together, \ntheir electrons forced into the nucleus, forming neutrons. You would have a neutron star. \nImagine a million really weighty cannonballs squeezed down to the size of a marble and\u2014\nwell, you\u2019re still not even close. The core of a neutron star is so dense that a single spoonful \nof matter from it would weigh 200 billion pounds. A spoonful! But there was more. Zwicky \nrealized that after the collapse of such a star there would be a huge amount of energy left \nover\u2014enough to make the biggest bang in the universe. He called these resultant explosions \nsupernovae. They would be\u2014they are\u2014the biggest events in creation. \n    On January 15, 1934, the journal Physical Review published a very concise abstract of a \npresentation that had been conducted by Zwicky and Baade the previous month at Stanford \nUniversity. Despite its extreme brevity\u2014one paragraph of twenty-four lines\u2014the abstract \ncontained an enormous amount of new science: it provided the first reference to supernovae \nand to neutron stars; convincingly explained their method of formation; correctly calculated \nthe scale of their explosiveness; and, as a kind of concluding bonus, connected supernova \nexplosions to the production of a mysterious new phenomenon called cosmic rays, which had \nrecently been found swarming through the universe. These ideas were revolutionary to say the \nleast. Neutron stars wouldn\u2019t be confirmed for thirty-four years. The cosmic rays notion,though considered plausible, hasn\u2019t been verified yet. Altogether, the abstract was, in the \nwords of Caltech astrophysicist Kip S. Thorne, \u201cone of the most prescient documents in the \nhistory of physics and astronomy.\u201d \n    Interestingly, Zwicky had almost no understanding of why any of this would happen. \nAccording to Thorne, \u201che did not understand the laws of physics well enough to be able to \nsubstantiate his ideas.\u201d Zwicky\u2019s talent was for big ideas. Others\u2014Baade mostly\u2014were left \nto do the mathematical sweeping up. \n    Zwicky also was the first to recognize that there wasn\u2019t nearly enough visible mass in the \nuniverse to hold galaxies together and that there must be some other gravitational influence\u2014\nwhat we now call dark matter. One thing he failed to see was that if a neutron star shrank \nenough it would become so dense that even light couldn\u2019t escape its immense gravitational \npull. You would have a black hole. Unfortunately, Zwicky was held in such disdain by most \nof his colleagues that his ideas attracted almost no notice. When, five years later, the great \nRobert Oppenheimer turned his attention to neutron stars in a landmark paper, he made not a \nsingle reference to any of Zwicky\u2019s work even though Zwicky had been working for years on \nthe same problem in an office just down the hall. Zwicky\u2019s deductions concerning dark matter \nwouldn\u2019t attract serious attention for nearly four decades. We can only assume that he did a \nlot of pushups in this period. \n  \n    Surprisingly little of the universe is visible to us when we incline our heads to the sky. Only \nabout 6,000 stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth, and only about 2,000 can be seen \nfrom any one spot. With binoculars the number of stars you can see from a single location \nrises to about 50,000, and with a small two-inch telescope it leaps to 300,000. With a sixteen-\ninch telescope, such as Evans uses, you begin to count not in stars but in galaxies. From his \ndeck, Evans supposes he can see between 50,000 and 100,000 galaxies, each containing tens \nof billions of stars. These are of course respectable numbers, but even with so much to take in, \nsupernovae are extremely rare. A star can burn for billions of years, but it dies just once and \nquickly, and only a few dying stars explode. Most expire quietly, like a campfire at dawn. In a \ntypical galaxy, consisting of a hundred billion stars, a supernova will occur on average once \nevery two or three hundred years. Finding a supernova therefore was a little bit like standing \non the observation platform of the Empire State Building with a telescope and searching \nwindows around Manhattan in the hope of finding, let us say, someone lighting a twenty-first-\nbirthday cake. \n    So when a hopeful and softspoken minister got in touch to ask if they had any usable field \ncharts for hunting supernovae, the astronomical community thought he was out of his mind. \nAt the time Evans had a ten-inch telescope\u2014a very respectable size for amateur stargazing \nbut hardly the sort of thing with which to do serious cosmology\u2014and he was proposing to \nfind one of the universe\u2019s rarer phenomena. In the whole of astronomical history before Evans \nstarted looking in 1980, fewer than sixty supernovae had been found. (At the time I visited \nhim, in August of 2001, he had just recorded his thirty-fourth visual discovery; a thirty-fifth \nfollowed three months later and a thirty-sixth in early 2003.) \n    Evans, however, had certain advantages. Most observers, like most people generally, are in \nthe northern hemisphere, so he had a lot of sky largely to himself, especially at first. He also \nhad speed and his uncanny memory. Large telescopes are cumbersome things, and much of \ntheir operational time is consumed with being maneuvered into position. Evans could swinghis little sixteen-inch telescope around like a tail gunner in a dogfight, spending no more than \na couple of seconds on any particular point in the sky. In consequence, he could observe \nperhaps four hundred galaxies in an evening while a large professional telescope would be \nlucky to do fifty or sixty. \n    Looking for supernovae is mostly a matter of not finding them. From 1980 to 1996 he \naveraged two discoveries a year\u2014not a huge payoff for hundreds of nights of peering and \npeering. Once he found three in fifteen days, but another time he went three years without \nfinding any at all. \n    \u201cThere is actually a certain value in not finding anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps cosmologists to \nwork out the rate at which galaxies are evolving. It\u2019s one of those rare areas where the \nabsence of evidenceis evidence.\u201d \n    On a table beside the telescope were stacks of photos and papers relevant to his pursuits, \nand he showed me some of them now. If you have ever looked through popular astronomical \npublications, and at some time you must have, you will know that they are generally full of \nrichly luminous color photos of distant nebulae and the like\u2014fairy-lit clouds of celestial light \nof the most delicate and moving splendor. Evans\u2019s working images are nothing like that. They \nare just blurry black-and-white photos with little points of haloed brightness. One he showed \nme depicted a swarm of stars with a trifling flare that I had to put close to my face to see. \nThis, Evans told me, was a star in a constellation called Fornax from a galaxy known to \nastronomy as NGC1365. (NGC stands for New General Catalogue, where these things are \nrecorded. Once it was a heavy book on someone\u2019s desk in Dublin; today, needless to say, it\u2019s \na database.) For sixty million silent years, the light from the star\u2019s spectacular demise traveled \nunceasingly through space until one night in August of 2001 it arrived at Earth in the form of \na puff of radiance, the tiniest brightening, in the night sky. It was of course Robert Evans on \nhis eucalypt-scented hillside who spotted it. \n    \u201cThere\u2019s something satisfying, I think,\u201d Evans said, \u201cabout the idea of light traveling for \nmillions of years through space and just at the right moment as it reaches Earth someone \nlooks at the right bit of sky and sees it. It just seems right that an event of that magnitude \nshould be witnessed.\u201d \n    Supernovae do much more than simply impart a sense of wonder. They come in several \ntypes (one of them discovered by Evans) and of these one in particular, known as a Ia \nsupernova, is important to astronomy because it always explodes in the same way, with the \nsame critical mass. For this reason it can be used as a standard candle to measure the \nexpansion rate of the universe. \n    In 1987 Saul Perlmutter at the Lawrence Berkeley lab in California, needing more Ia \nsupernovae than visual sightings were providing, set out to find a more systematic method of \nsearching for them. Perlmutter devised a nifty system using sophisticated computers and \ncharge-coupled devices\u2014in essence, really good digital cameras. It automated supernova \nhunting. Telescopes could now take thousands of pictures and let a computer detect the \ntelltale bright spots that marked a supernova explosion. In five years, with the new technique, \nPerlmutter and his colleagues at Berkeley found forty-two supernovae. Now even amateurs \nare finding supernovae with charge-coupled devices. \u201cWith CCDs you can aim a telescope at \nthe sky and go watch television,\u201d Evans said with a touch of dismay. \u201cIt took all the romance \nout of it.\u201dI asked him if he was tempted to adopt the new technology. \u201cOh, no,\u201d he said, \u201cI enjoy my \nway too much. Besides\u201d\u2014he gave a nod at the photo of his latest supernova and smiled\u2014\u201cI \ncan still beat them sometimes.\u201d \n    The question that naturally occurs is \u201cWhat would it be like if a star exploded nearby?\u201d Our \nnearest stellar neighbor, as we have seen, is Alpha Centauri, 4.3 light-years away. I had \nimagined that if there were an explosion there we would have 4.3 years to watch the light of \nthis magnificent event spreading across the sky, as if tipped from a giant can. What would it \nbe like if we had four years and four months to watch an inescapable doom advancing toward \nus, knowing that when it finally arrived it would blow the skin right off our bones? Would  \npeople still go to work? Would farmers plant crops? Would anyone deliver them to the stores? \n    Weeks later, back in the town in New Hampshire where I live, I put these questions to John \nThorstensen, an astronomer at Dartmouth College. \u201cOh no,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThe news of \nsuch an event travels out at the speed of light, but so does the destructiveness, so you\u2019d learn \nabout it and die from it in the same instant. But don\u2019t worry because it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d \n    For the blast of a supernova explosion to kill you, he explained, you would have to be \n\u201cridiculously close\u201d\u2014probably within ten light-years or so. \u201cThe danger would be various \ntypes of radiation\u2014cosmic rays and so on.\u201d These would produce fabulous auroras, \nshimmering curtains of spooky light that would fill the whole sky. This would not be a good \nthing. Anything potent enough to put on such a show could well blow away the \nmagnetosphere, the magnetic zone high above the Earth that normally protects us from \nultraviolet rays and other cosmic assaults. Without the magnetosphere anyone unfortunate \nenough to step into sunlight would pretty quickly take on the appearance of, let us say, an \novercooked pizza. \n    The reason we can be reasonably confident that such an event won\u2019t happen in our corner \nof the galaxy, Thorstensen said, is that it takes a particular kind of star to make a supernova in \nthe first place. A candidate star must be ten to twenty times as massive as our own Sun and \n\u201cwe don\u2019t have anything of the requisite size that\u2019s that close. The universe is a mercifully big \nplace.\u201d The nearest likely candidate he added, is Betelgeuse, whose various sputterings have \nfor years suggested that something interestingly unstable is going on there. But Betelgeuse is \nfifty thousand light-years away. \n    Only half a dozen times in recorded history have supernovae been close enough to be \nvisible to the naked eye. One was a blast in 1054 that created the Crab Nebula. Another, in \n1604, made a star bright enough to be seen during the day for over three weeks. The most \nrecent was in 1987, when a supernova flared in a zone of the cosmos known as the Large \nMagellanic Cloud, but that was only barely visible and only in the southern hemisphere\u2014and \nit was a comfortably safe 169,000 light-years away. \n  \n    Supernovae are significant to us in one other decidedly central way. Without them we \nwouldn\u2019t be here. You will recall the cosmological conundrum with which we ended the first \nchapter\u2014that the Big Bang created lots of light gases but no heavy elements. Those came \nlater, but for a very long time nobody could figure out  how they came later. The problem was \nthat you needed something really hot\u2014hotter even than the middle of the hottest stars\u2014to \nforge carbon and iron and the other elements without which we would be distressinglyimmaterial. Supernovae provided the explanation, and it was an English cosmologist almost \nas singular in manner as Fritz Zwicky who figured it out. \n    He was a Yorkshireman named Fred Hoyle. Hoyle, who died in 2001, was described in an \nobituary in Nature as a \u201ccosmologist and controversialist\u201d and both of those he most certainly \nwas. He was, according to Nature \u2019s obituary, \u201cembroiled in controversy for most of his life\u201d \nand \u201cput his name to much rubbish.\u201d He claimed, for instance, and without evidence, that the \nNatural History Museum\u2019s treasured fossil of an Archaeopteryx was a forgery along the lines \nof the Piltdown hoax, causing much exasperation to the museum\u2019s paleontologists, who had to \nspend days fielding phone calls from journalists from all over the world. He also believed that \nEarth was not only seeded by life from space but also by many of its diseases, such as \ninfluenza and bubonic plague, and suggested at one point that humans evolved projecting \nnoses with the nostrils underneath as a way of keeping cosmic pathogens from falling into \nthem. \n    It was he who coined the term \u201cBig Bang,\u201d in a moment of facetiousness, for a radio \nbroadcast in 1952. He pointed out that nothing in our understanding of physics could account \nfor why everything, gathered to a point, would suddenly and dramatically begin to expand. \nHoyle favored a steady-state theory in which the universe was constantly expanding and \ncontinually creating new matter as it went. Hoyle also realized that if stars imploded they \nwould liberate huge amounts of heat\u2014100 million degrees or more, enough to begin to \ngenerate the heavier elements in a process known as nucleosynthesis. In 1957, working with \nothers, Hoyle showed how the heavier elements were formed in supernova explosions. For \nthis work, W. A. Fowler, one of his collaborators, received a Nobel Prize. Hoyle, shamefully, \ndid not. \n    According to Hoyle\u2019s theory, an exploding star would generate enough heat to create all the \nnew elements and spray them into the cosmos where they would form gaseous clouds\u2014the \ninterstellar medium as it is known\u2014that could eventually coalesce into new solar systems. \nWith the new theories it became possible at last to construct plausible scenarios for how we \ngot here. What we now think we know is this: \n    About 4.6 billion years ago, a great swirl of gas and dust some 15 billion miles across \naccumulated in space where we are now and began to aggregate. Virtually all of it\u201499.9 \npercent of the mass of the solar system\u2014went to make the Sun. Out of the floating material \nthat was left over, two microscopic grains floated close enough together to be joined by \nelectrostatic forces. This was the moment of conception for our planet. All over the inchoate \nsolar system, the same was happening. Colliding dust grains formed larger and larger clumps. \nEventually the clumps grew large enough to be called planetesimals. As these endlessly \nbumped and collided, they fractured or split or recombined in endless random permutations, \nbut in every encounter there was a winner, and some of the winners grew big enough to \ndominate the orbit around which they traveled. \n    It all happened remarkably quickly. To grow from a tiny cluster of grains to a baby planet \nsome hundreds of miles across is thought to have taken only a few tens of thousands of years. \nIn just 200 million years, possibly less, the Earth was essentially formed, though still molten \nand subject to constant bombardment from all the debris that remained floating about. \n    At this point, about 4.5 billion years ago, an object the size of Mars crashed into Earth, \nblowing out enough material to form a companion sphere, the Moon. Within weeks, it is \nthought, the flung material had reassembled itself into a single clump, and within a year it hadformed into the spherical rock that companions us yet. Most of the lunar material, it is \nthought, came from the Earth\u2019s crust, not its core, which is why the Moon has so little iron \nwhile we have a lot. The theory, incidentally, is almost always presented as a recent one, but \nin fact it was first proposed in the 1940s by Reginald Daly of Harvard. The only recent thing \nabout it is people paying any attention to it. \n    When Earth was only about a third of its eventual size, it was probably already beginning to \nform an atmosphere, mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, methane, and sulfur. Hardly the sort \nof stuff that we would associate with life, and yet from this noxious stew life formed. Carbon \ndioxide is a powerful greenhouse gas. This was a good thing because the Sun was \nsignificantly dimmer back then. Had we not had the benefit of a greenhouse effect, the Earth \nmight well have frozen over permanently, and life might never have gotten a toehold. But \nsomehow life did. \n    For the next 500 million years the young Earth continued to be pelted relentlessly by \ncomets, meteorites, and other galactic debris, which brought water to fill the oceans and the \ncomponents necessary for the successful formation of life. It was a singularly hostile \nenvironment and yet somehow life got going. Some tiny bag of chemicals twitched and \nbecame animate. We were on our way. \n    Four billion years later people began to wonder how it had all happened. And it is there that \nour story next takes us.PART  II     THE SIZE OF THE EARTH \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNature and Nature\u2019s laws lay hid in  \n \n \n \n   night; \n \n \n \nGod said, Let Newton be! And all \n \n \n \n   was light. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-Alexander Pope", "4": "4    THE MEASURE OF THINGS \nIF YOU HAD to select the least convivial scientific field trip of all time, you could certainly \ndo worse than the French Royal Academy of Sciences\u2019 Peruvian expedition of 1735. Led by a \nhydrologist named Pierre Bouguer and a soldier-mathematician named Charles Marie de La \nCondamine, it was a party of scientists and adventurers who traveled to Peru with the purpose \nof triangulating distances through the Andes. \n    At the time people had lately become infected with a powerful desire to understand the \nEarth\u2014to determine how old it was, and how massive, where it hung in space, and how it had \ncome to be. The French party\u2019s goal was to help settle the question of the circumference of \nthe planet by measuring the length of one degree of meridian (or 1/360 of the distance around \nthe planet) along a line reaching from Yarouqui, near Quito, to just beyond Cuenca in what is \nnow Ecuador, a distance of about two hundred miles.1  \nAlmost at once things began to go wrong, sometimes spectacularly so. In Quito, the visitors \nsomehow provoked the locals and were chased out of town by a mob armed with stones. Soon \nafter, the expedition\u2019s doctor was murdered in a misunderstanding over a woman. The \nbotanist became deranged. Others died of fevers and falls. The third most senior member of \nthe party, a man named Pierre Godin, ran off with a thirteen-year-old girl and could not be \ninduced to return. \nAt one point the group had to suspend work for eight months while La Condamine rode off to \nLima to sort out a problem with their permits. Eventually he and Bouguer stopped speaking \nand refused to work together. Everywhere the dwindling party went it was met with the \ndeepest suspicions from officials who found it difficult to believe that a group of French \nscientists would travel halfway around the world to measure the world. That made no sense at \nall. Two and a half centuries later it still seems a reasonable question. Why didn\u2019t the French \nmake their measurements in France and save themselves all the bother and discomfort of their \nAndean adventure? \nThe answer lies partly with the fact that eighteenth-century scientists, the French in particular, \nseldom did things simply if an absurdly demanding alternative was available, and partly with \na practical problem that had first arisen with the English astronomer Edmond Halley many \nyears before\u2014long before Bouguer and La Condamine dreamed of going to South America, \nmuch less had a reason for doing so. \n                                                 \n* Triangulation, their chosen method, was a popular technique based on the geometric fact that if you know the \nlength of one side of a triangle and the angles of two corners, you can work out all its other dimensions without \nleaving your chair. Suppose, by way of example, that you and I decided we wished to know how far it is to the \nMoon. Using triangulation, the first thing we must do is put some distance between us, so let's say for argument \nthat you stay in Paris and I go to Moscow and we both look at the Moon at the same time. Now if you imagine a \nline connecting the three principals of this exercise-that is, you and I and the Moon-it forms a triangle. Measure \nthe length of the baseline between you and me and the angles of our two corners and the rest can be simply \ncalculated. (Because the interior angles of a triangle always add up to 180 degrees, if you know the sum of two \nof the angles you can instantly calculate the third; and knowing the precise shape of a triangle and the length of \none side tells you the lengths of the other sides.) This was in fact the method use by a Greek astronomer, \nHipparchus of Nicaea, in 150 B.C. to work out the Moon's distance from Earth. At ground level, the principles of \ntriangulation are the same, except that the triangles don't reach into space but rather are laid side to side on a \nmap. In measuring a degree of meridian, the surveyors would create a sort of chain of triangles marching across \nthe landscape.Halley was an exceptional figure. In the course of a long and productive career, he was a \nsea captain, a cartographer, a professor of geometry at the University of Oxford, deputy \ncontroller of the Royal Mint, astronomer royal, and inventor of the deep-sea diving bell. He \nwrote authoritatively on magnetism, tides, and the motions of the planets, and fondly on the \neffects of opium. He invented the weather map and actuarial table, proposed methods for \nworking out the age of the Earth and its distance from the Sun, even devised a practical \nmethod for keeping fish fresh out of season. The one thing he didn\u2019t do, interestingly enough, \nwas discover the comet that bears his name. He merely recognized that the comet he saw in \n1682 was the same one that had been seen by others in 1456, 1531, and 1607. It didn\u2019t \nbecome Halley\u2019s comet until 1758, some sixteen years after his death. \n    For all his achievements, however, Halley\u2019s greatest contribution to human knowledge may \nsimply have been to take part in a modest scientific wager with two other worthies of his day: \nRobert Hooke, who is perhaps best remembered now as the first person to describe a cell, and \nthe great and stately Sir Christopher Wren, who was actually an astronomer first and architect \nsecond, though that is not often generally remembered now. In 1683, Halley, Hooke, and \nWren were dining in London when the conversation turned to the motions of celestial objects. \nIt was known that planets were inclined to orbit in a particular kind of oval known as an \nellipse\u2014\u201ca very specific and precise curve,\u201d to quote Richard Feynman\u2014but it wasn\u2019t \nunderstood why. Wren generously offered a prize worth forty shillings (equivalent to a couple \nof weeks\u2019 pay) to whichever of the men could provide a solution. \n    Hooke, who was well known for taking credit for ideas that weren\u2019t necessarily his own, \nclaimed that he had solved the problem already but declined now to share it on the interesting \nand inventive grounds that it would rob others of the satisfaction of discovering the answer for \nthemselves. He would instead \u201cconceal it for some time, that others might know how to value \nit.\u201d If he thought any more on the matter, he left no evidence of it. Halley, however, became \nconsumed with finding the answer, to the point that the following year he traveled to \nCambridge and boldly called upon the university\u2019s Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, Isaac \nNewton, in the hope that he could help. \n    Newton was a decidedly odd figure\u2014brilliant beyond measure, but solitary, joyless, prickly \nto the point of paranoia, famously distracted (upon swinging his feet out of bed in the morning \nhe would reportedly sometimes sit for hours, immobilized by the sudden rush of thoughts to \nhis head), and capable of the most riveting strangeness. He built his own laboratory, the first \nat Cambridge, but then engaged in the most bizarre experiments. Once he inserted a bodkin\u2014\na long needle of the sort used for sewing leather\u2014into his eye socket and rubbed it around \n\u201cbetwixt my eye and the bone as near to [the] backside of my eye as I could\u201d just to see what \nwould happen. What happened, miraculously, was nothing\u2014at least nothing lasting. On \nanother occasion, he stared at the Sun for as long as he could bear, to determine what effect it \nwould have upon his vision. Again he escaped lasting damage, though he had to spend some \ndays in a darkened room before his eyes forgave him. \n    Set atop these odd beliefs and quirky traits, however, was the mind of a supreme genius\u2014\nthough even when working in conventional channels he often showed a tendency to \npeculiarity. As a student, frustrated by the limitations of conventional mathematics, he \ninvented an entirely new form, the calculus, but then told no one about it for twenty-seven \nyears. In like manner, he did work in optics that transformed our understanding of light and \nlaid the foundation for the science of spectroscopy, and again chose not to share the results for \nthree decades.For all his brilliance, real science accounted for only a part of his interests. At least half his \nworking life was given over to alchemy and wayward religious pursuits. These were not mere \ndabblings but wholehearted devotions. He was a secret adherent of a dangerously heretical \nsect called Arianism, whose principal tenet was the belief that there had been no Holy Trinity \n(slightly ironic since Newton\u2019s college at Cambridge was Trinity). He spent endless hours \nstudying the floor plan of the lost Temple of King Solomon in Jerusalem (teaching himself \nHebrew in the process, the better to scan original texts) in the belief that it held mathematical \nclues to the dates of the second coming of Christ and the end of the world. His attachment to \nalchemy was no less ardent. In 1936, the economist John Maynard Keynes bought a trunk of \nNewton\u2019s papers at auction and discovered with astonishment that they were overwhelmingly \npreoccupied not with optics or planetary motions, but with a single-minded quest to turn base \nmetals into precious ones. An analysis of a strand of Newton\u2019s hair in the 1970s found it \ncontained mercury\u2014an element of interest to alchemists, hatters, and thermometer-makers \nbut almost no one else\u2014at a concentration some forty times the natural level. It is perhaps \nlittle wonder that he had trouble remembering to rise in the morning. \n    Quite what Halley expected to get from him when he made his unannounced visit in August \n1684 we can only guess. But thanks to the later account of a Newton confidant, Abraham \nDeMoivre, we do have a record of one of science\u2019s most historic encounters: \n \n \nIn 1684 Dr Halley came to visit at Cambridge [and] after they had some time \ntogether the Drasked him what he thought the curve would be that would be \ndescribed by the Planets supposing the force of attraction toward the Sun to be \nreciprocal to the square of their distance from it. \n \nThis was a reference to a piece of mathematics known as the inverse square law, which Halley \nwas convinced lay at the heart of the explanation, though he wasn\u2019t sure exactly how. \n \n \nSr Isaac replied immediately that it would be an [ellipse]. The Doctor, struck with \njoy & amazement, asked him how he knew it. \u2018Why,\u2019 saith he, \u2018I have calculated \nit,\u2019 whereupon DrHalley asked him for his calculation without farther delay, \nSrIsaac looked among his papers but could not find it. \n \n    This was astounding\u2014like someone saying he had found a cure for cancer but couldn\u2019t \nremember where he had put the formula. Pressed by Halley, Newton agreed to redo the \ncalculations and produce a paper. He did as promised, but then did much more. He retired for \ntwo years of intensive reflection and scribbling, and at length produced his masterwork: the \nPhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica or Mathematical Principles of Natural \nPhilosophy, better known as the Principia . \n    Once in a great while, a few times in history, a human mind produces an observation so \nacute and unexpected that people can\u2019t quite decide which is the more amazing\u2014the fact or \nthe thinking of it. Principia was one of those moments. It made Newton instantly famous. Forthe rest of his life he would be draped with plaudits and honors, becoming, among much else, \nthe first person in Britain knighted for scientific achievement. Even the great German \nmathematician Gottfried von Leibniz, with whom Newton had a long, bitter fight over priority \nfor the invention of the calculus, thought his contributions to mathematics equal to all the \naccumulated work that had preceded him. \u201cNearer the gods no mortal may approach,\u201d wrote \nHalley in a sentiment that was endlessly echoed by his contemporaries and by many others \nsince. \n    Although the Principia has been called \u201cone of the most inaccessible books ever written\u201d \n(Newton intentionally made it difficult so that he wouldn\u2019t be pestered by mathematical \n\u201csmatterers,\u201d as he called them), it was a beacon to those who could follow it. It not only \nexplained mathematically the orbits of heavenly bodies, but also identified the attractive force \nthat got them moving in the first place\u2014gravity. Suddenly every motion in the universe made \nsense. \n    At Principia \u2019s heart were Newton\u2019s three laws of motion (which state, very baldly, that a \nthing moves in the direction in which it is pushed; that it will keep moving in a straight line \nuntil some other force acts to slow or deflect it; and that every action has an opposite and \nequal reaction) and his universal law of gravitation. This states that every object in the \nuniverse exerts a tug on every other. It may not seem like it, but as you sit here now you are \npulling everything around you\u2014walls, ceiling, lamp, pet cat\u2014toward you with your own little \n(indeed, very little) gravitational field. And these things are also pulling on you. It was \nNewton who realized that the pull of any two objects is, to quote Feynman again, \n\u201cproportional to the mass of each and varies inversely as the square of the distance between \nthem.\u201d Put another way, if you double the distance between two objects, the attraction \nbetween them becomes four times weaker. This can be expressed with the formula \nF = Gmm \nR2 \nwhich is of course way beyond anything that most of us could make practical use of, but at \nleast we can appreciate that it is elegantly compact. A couple of brief multiplications, a simple \ndivision, and, bingo, you know your gravitational position wherever you go. It was the first \nreally universal law of nature ever propounded by a human mind, which is why Newton is \nregarded with such universal esteem. \n    Principia\u2019s production was not without drama. To Halley\u2019s horror, just as work was \nnearing completion Newton and Hooke fell into dispute over the priority for the inverse \nsquare law and Newton refused to release the crucial third volume, without which the first \ntwo made little sense. Only with some frantic shuttle diplomacy and the most liberal \napplications of flattery did Halley manage finally to extract the concluding volume from the \nerratic professor. \n    Halley\u2019s traumas were not yet quite over. The Royal Society had promised to publish the \nwork, but now pulled out, citing financial embarrassment. The year before the society had \nbacked a costly flop called The History of Fishes , and they now suspected that the market for \na book on mathematical principles would be less than clamorous. Halley, whose means were \nnot great, paid for the book\u2019s publication out of his own pocket. Newton, as was his custom, \ncontributed nothing. To make matters worse, Halley at this time had just accepted a position \nas the society\u2019s clerk, and he was informed that the society could no longer afford to providehim with a promised salary of \u00a350 per annum. He was to be paid instead in copies of The \nHistory of Fishes . \n  \n    Newton\u2019s laws explained so many things\u2014the slosh and roll of ocean tides, the motions of \nplanets, why cannonballs trace a particular trajectory before thudding back to Earth, why we \naren\u2019t flung into space as the planet spins beneath us at hundreds of miles an hour2\u2014that it \ntook a while for all their implications to seep in. But one revelation became almost \nimmediately controversial. \n    This was the suggestion that the Earth is not quite round. According to Newton\u2019s theory, \nthe centrifugal force of the Earth\u2019s spin should result in a slight flattening at the poles and a \nbulging at the equator, which would make the planet slightly oblate. That meant that the \nlength of a degree wouldn\u2019t be the same in Italy as it was in Scotland. Specifically, the length \nwould shorten as you moved away from the poles. This was not good news for those people \nwhose measurements of the Earth were based on the assumption that the Earth was a perfect \nsphere, which was everyone. \n    For half a century people had been trying to work out the size of the Earth, mostly by \nmaking very exacting measurements. One of the first such attempts was by an English \nmathematician named Richard Norwood. As a young man Norwood had traveled to Bermuda \nwith a diving bell modeled on Halley\u2019s device, intending to make a fortune scooping pearls \nfrom the seabed. The scheme failed because there were no pearls and anyway Norwood\u2019s bell \ndidn\u2019t work, but Norwood was not one to waste an experience. In the early seventeenth \ncentury Bermuda was well known among ships\u2019 captains for being hard to locate. The \nproblem was that the ocean was big, Bermuda small, and the navigational tools for dealing \nwith this disparity hopelessly inadequate. There wasn\u2019t even yet an agreed length for a \nnautical mile. Over the breadth of an ocean the smallest miscalculations would become \nmagnified so that ships often missed Bermuda-sized targets by dismaying margins. Norwood, \nwhose first love was trigonometry and thus angles, decided to bring a little mathematical rigor \nto navigation and to that end he determined to calculate the length of a degree. \n    Starting with his back against the Tower of London, Norwood spent two devoted years \nmarching 208 miles north to York, repeatedly stretching and measuring a length of chain as \nhe went, all the while making the most meticulous adjustments for the rise and fall of the land \nand the meanderings of the road. The final step was to measure the angle of the Sun at York at \nthe same time of day and on the same day of the year as he had made his first measurement in \nLondon. From this, he reasoned he could determine the length of one degree of the Earth\u2019s \nmeridian and thus calculate the distance around the whole. It was an almost ludicrously \nambitious undertaking\u2014a mistake of the slightest fraction of a degree would throw the whole \nthing out by miles\u2014but in fact, as Norwood proudly declaimed, he was accurate to \u201cwithin a \nscantling\u201d\u2014or, more precisely, to within about six hundred yards. In metric terms, his figure \nworked out at 110.72 kilometers per degree of arc. \n    In 1637, Norwood\u2019s masterwork of navigation, The Seaman\u2019s Practice , was published and \nfound an immediate following. It went through seventeen editions and was still in print \ntwenty-five years after his death. Norwood returned to Bermuda with his family, becoming a \n                                                 \n2 How fast you are spinning depends on where you are. The speed of the Earth\u2019s spin varies from a little over \n1,000 miles an hour at the equator to 0 at the poles.successful planter and devoting his leisure hours to his first love, trigonometry. He survived \nthere for thirty-eight years and it would be pleasing to report that he passed this span in \nhappiness and adulation. In fact, he didn\u2019t. On the crossing from England, his two young sons \nwere placed in a cabin with the Reverend Nathaniel White, and somehow so successfully \ntraumatized the young vicar that he devoted much of the rest of his career to persecuting \nNorwood in any small way he could think of. \n    Norwood\u2019s two daughters brought their father additional pain by making poor marriages. \nOne of the husbands, possibly incited by the vicar, continually laid small charges against \nNorwood in court, causing him much exasperation and necessitating repeated trips across \nBermuda to defend himself. Finally in the 1650s witch trials came to Bermuda and Norwood \nspent his final years in severe unease that his papers on trigonometry, with their arcane \nsymbols, would be taken as communications with the devil and that he would be treated to a \ndreadful execution. So little is known of Norwood that it may in fact be that he deserved his \nunhappy declining years. What is certainly true is that he got them. \n    Meanwhile, the momentum for determining the Earth\u2019s circumference passed to France. \nThere, the astronomer Jean Picard devised an impressively complicated method of \ntriangulation involving quadrants, pendulum clocks, zenith sectors, and telescopes (for \nobserving the motions of the moons of Jupiter). After two years of trundling and triangulating \nhis way across France, in 1669 he announced a more accurate measure of 110.46 kilometers \nfor one degree of arc. This was a great source of pride for the French, but it was predicated on \nthe assumption that the Earth was a perfect sphere\u2014which Newton now said it was not. \n  \n    To complicate matters, after Picard\u2019s death the father-and-son team of Giovanni and \nJacques Cassini repeated Picard\u2019s experiments over a larger area and came up with results that \nsuggested that the Earth was fatter not at the equator but at the poles\u2014that Newton, in other \nwords, was exactly wrong. It was this that prompted the Academy of Sciences to dispatch \nBouguer and La Condamine to South America to take new measurements. \n    They chose the Andes because they needed to measure near the equator, to determine if \nthere really was a difference in sphericity there, and because they reasoned that mountains \nwould give them good sightlines. In fact, the mountains of Peru were so constantly lost in \ncloud that the team often had to wait weeks for an hour\u2019s clear surveying. On top of that, they \nhad selected one of the most nearly impossible terrains on Earth. Peruvians refer to their \nlandscape as muy accidentado \u2014\u201cmuch accidented\u201d\u2014and this it most certainly is. The \nFrench had not only to scale some of the world\u2019s most challenging mountains\u2014mountains \nthat defeated even their mules\u2014but to reach the mountains they had to ford wild rivers, hack \ntheir way through jungles, and cross miles of high, stony desert, nearly all of it uncharted and \nfar from any source of supplies. But Bouguer and La Condamine were nothing if not \ntenacious, and they stuck to the task for nine and a half long, grim, sun-blistered years. \nShortly before concluding the project, they received word that a second French team, taking \nmeasurements in northern Scandinavia (and facing notable discomforts of their own, from \nsquelching bogs to dangerous ice floes), had found that a degree was in fact longer near the \npoles, as Newton had promised. The Earth was forty-three kilometers stouter when measured \nequatorially than when measured from top to bottom around the poles. \n    Bouguer and La Condamine thus had spent nearly a decade working toward a result they \ndidn\u2019t wish to find only to learn now that they weren\u2019t even the first to find it. Listlessly, theycompleted their survey, which confirmed that the first French team was correct. Then, still not \nspeaking, they returned to the coast and took separate ships home. \n  \n    Something else conjectured by Newton in the Principia was that a plumb bob hung near a \nmountain would incline very slightly toward the mountain, affected by the mountain\u2019s \ngravitational mass as well as by the Earth\u2019s. This was more than a curious fact. If you \nmeasured the deflection accurately and worked out the mass of the mountain, you could \ncalculate the universal gravitational constant\u2014that is, the basic value of gravity, known as \nG\u2014and along with it the mass of the Earth. \n    Bouguer and La Condamine had tried this on Peru\u2019s Mount Chimborazo, but had been \ndefeated by both the technical difficulties and their own squabbling, and so the notion lay \ndormant for another thirty years until resurrected in England by Nevil Maskelyne, the \nastronomer royal. In Dava Sobel\u2019s popular book Longitude, Maskelyne is presented as a ninny \nand villain for failing to appreciate the brilliance of the clockmaker John Harrison, and this \nmay be so, but we are indebted to him in other ways not mentioned in her book, not least for \nhis successful scheme to weigh the Earth. Maskelyne realized that the nub of the problem lay \nwith finding a mountain of sufficiently regular shape to judge its mass. \n    At his urging, the Royal Society agreed to engage a reliable figure to tour the British Isles \nto see if such a mountain could be found. Maskelyne knew just such a person\u2014the \nastronomer and surveyor Charles Mason. Maskelyne and Mason had become friends eleven \nyears earlier while engaged in a project to measure an astronomical event of great importance: \nthe passage of the planet Venus across the face of the Sun. The tireless Edmond Halley had \nsuggested years before that if you measured one of these passages from selected points on the \nEarth, you could use the principles of triangulation to work out the distance to the Sun, and \nfrom that calibrate the distances to all the other bodies in the solar system. \n    Unfortunately, transits of Venus, as they are known, are an irregular occurrence. They \ncome in pairs eight years apart, but then are absent for a century or more, and there were none \nin Halley\u2019s lifetime.3 But the idea simmered and when the next transit came due in 1761, \nnearly two decades after Halley\u2019s death, the scientific world was ready\u2014indeed, more ready \nthan it had been for an astronomical event before. \n    With the instinct for ordeal that characterized the age, scientists set off for more than a \nhundred locations around the globe\u2014to Siberia, China, South Africa, Indonesia, and the \nwoods of Wisconsin, among many others. France dispatched thirty-two observers, Britain \neighteen more, and still others set out from Sweden, Russia, Italy, Germany, Ireland, and \nelsewhere. \n    It was history\u2019s first cooperative international scientific venture, and almost everywhere it \nran into problems. Many observers were waylaid by war, sickness, or shipwreck. Others made \ntheir destinations but opened their crates to find equipment broken or warped by tropical heat. \nOnce again the French seemed fated to provide the most memorably unlucky participants. \nJean Chappe spent months traveling to Siberia by coach, boat, and sleigh, nursing his delicate \ninstruments over every perilous bump, only to find the last vital stretch blocked by swollen \n                                                 \n3 The next transit will be on June 8, 2004, with a second in 2012. There were none in the twentieth century.rivers, the result of unusually heavy spring rains, which the locals were swift to blame on him \nafter they saw him pointing strange instruments at the sky. Chappe managed to escape with \nhis life, but with no useful measurements. \n    Unluckier still was Guillaume Le Gentil, whose experiences are wonderfully summarized \nby Timothy Ferris in Coming of Age in the Milky Way . Le Gentil set off from France a year \nahead of time to observe the transit from India, but various setbacks left him still at sea on the \nday of the transit\u2014just about the worst place to be since steady measurements were \nimpossible on a pitching ship. \n    Undaunted, Le Gentil continued on to India to await the next transit in 1769. With eight \nyears to prepare, he erected a first-rate viewing station, tested and retested his instruments, \nand had everything in a state of perfect readiness. On the morning of the second transit, June \n4, 1769, he awoke to a fine day, but, just as Venus began its pass, a cloud slid in front of the \nSun and remained there for almost exactly the duration of the transit: three hours, fourteen \nminutes, and seven seconds. \n    Stoically, Le Gentil packed up his instruments and set off for the nearest port, but en route \nhe contracted dysentery and was laid up for nearly a year. Still weakened, he finally made it \nonto a ship. It was nearly wrecked in a hurricane off the African coast. When at last he \nreached home, eleven and a half years after setting off, and having achieved nothing, he \ndiscovered that his relatives had had him declared dead in his absence and had \nenthusiastically plundered his estate. \n  \n    In comparison, the disappointments experienced by Britain\u2019s eighteen scattered observers \nwere mild. Mason found himself paired with a young surveyor named Jeremiah Dixon and \napparently they got along well, for they formed a lasting partnership. Their instructions were \nto travel to Sumatra and chart the transit there, but after just one night at sea their ship was \nattacked by a French frigate. (Although scientists were in an internationally cooperative \nmood, nations weren\u2019t.) Mason and Dixon sent a note to the Royal Society observing that it \nseemed awfully dangerous on the high seas and wondering if perhaps the whole thing \noughtn\u2019t to be called off. In reply they received a swift and chilly rebuke, noting that they had \nalready been paid, that the nation and scientific community were counting on them, and that \ntheir failure to proceed would result in the irretrievable loss of their reputations. Chastened, \nthey sailed on, but en route word reached them that Sumatra had fallen to the French and so \nthey observed the transit inconclusively from the Cape of Good Hope. On the way home they \nstopped on the lonely Atlantic outcrop of St. Helena, where they met Maskelyne, whose \nobservations had been thwarted by cloud cover. Mason and Maskelyne formed a solid \nfriendship and spent several happy, and possibly even mildly useful, weeks charting tidal \nflows. \n    Soon afterward, Maskelyne returned to England where he became astronomer royal, and \nMason and Dixon\u2014now evidently more seasoned\u2014set off for four long and often perilous \nyears surveying their way through 244 miles of dangerous American wilderness to settle a \nboundary dispute between the estates of William Penn and Lord Baltimore and their \nrespective colonies of Pennsylvania and Maryland. The result was the famous Mason and \nDixon line, which later took on symbolic importance as the dividing line between the slave \nand free states. (Although the line was their principal task, they also contributed several \nastronomical surveys, including one of the century\u2019s most accurate measurements of a degreeof meridian\u2014an achievement that brought them far more acclaim in England than the settling \nof a boundary dispute between spoiled aristocrats.) \n    Back in Europe, Maskelyne and his counterparts in Germany and France were forced to the \nconclusion that the transit measurements of 1761 were essentially a failure. One of the \nproblems, ironically, was that there were too many observations, which when brought \ntogether often proved contradictory and impossible to resolve. The successful charting of a \nVenusian transit fell instead to a little-known Yorkshire-born sea captain named James Cook, \nwho watched the 1769 transit from a sunny hilltop in Tahiti, and then went on to chart and \nclaim Australia for the British crown. Upon his return there was now enough information for \nthe French astronomer Joseph Lalande to calculate that the mean distance from the Earth to \nthe Sun was a little over 150 million kilometers. (Two further transits in the nineteenth \ncentury allowed astronomers to put the figure at 149.59 million kilometers, where it has \nremained ever since. The precise distance, we now know, is 149.597870691 million \nkilometers.) The Earth at last had a position in space. \n  \n    As for Mason and Dixon, they returned to England as scientific heroes and, for reasons \nunknown, dissolved their partnership. Considering the frequency with which they turn up at \nseminal events in eighteenth-century science, remarkably little is known about either man. No \nlikenesses exist and few written references. Of Dixon the Dictionary of National Biography \nnotes intriguingly that he was \u201csaid to have been born in a coal mine,\u201d but then leaves it to the \nreader\u2019s imagination to supply a plausible explanatory circumstance, and adds that he died at \nDurham in 1777. Apart from his name and long association with Mason, nothing more is \nknown. \n    Mason is only slightly less shadowy. We know that in 1772, at Maskelyne\u2019s behest, he \naccepted the commission to find a suitable mountain for the gravitational deflection \nexperiment, at length reporting back that the mountain they needed was in the central Scottish \nHighlands, just above Loch Tay, and was called Schiehallion. Nothing, however, would \ninduce him to spend a summer surveying it. He never returned to the field again. His next \nknown movement was in 1786 when, abruptly and mysteriously, he turned up in Philadelphia \nwith his wife and eight children, apparently on the verge of destitution. He had not been back \nto America since completing his survey there eighteen years earlier and had no known reason \nfor being there, or any friends or patrons to greet him. A few weeks later he was dead. \n  \n    With Mason refusing to survey the mountain, the job fell to Maskelyne. So for four months \nin the summer of 1774, Maskelyne lived in a tent in a remote Scottish glen and spent his days \ndirecting a team of surveyors, who took hundreds of measurements from every possible \nposition. To find the mass of the mountain from all these numbers required a great deal of \ntedious calculating, for which a mathematician named Charles Hutton was engaged. The \nsurveyors had covered a map with scores of figures, each marking an elevation at some point \non or around the mountain. It was essentially just a confusing mass of numbers, but Hutton \nnoticed that if he used a pencil to connect points of equal height, it all became much more \norderly. Indeed, one could instantly get a sense of the overall shape and slope of the mountain. \nHe had invented contour lines.Extrapolating from his Schiehallion measurements, Hutton calculated the mass of the Earth \nat 5,000 million million tons, from which could reasonably be deduced the masses of all the \nother major bodies in the solar system, including the Sun. So from this one experiment we \nlearned the masses of the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the other planets and their moons, and got \ncontour lines into the bargain\u2014not bad for a summer\u2019s work. \n    Not everyone was satisfied with the results, however. The shortcoming of the Schiehallion \nexperiment was that it was not possible to get a truly accurate figure without knowing the \nactual density of the mountain. For convenience, Hutton had assumed that the mountain had \nthe same density as ordinary stone, about 2.5 times that of water, but this was little more than \nan educated guess. \n    One improbable-seeming person who turned his mind to the matter was a country parson \nnamed John Michell, who resided in the lonely Yorkshire village of Thornhill. Despite his \nremote and comparatively humble situation, Michell was one of the great scientific thinkers of \nthe eighteenth century and much esteemed for it. \n    Among a great deal else, he perceived the wavelike nature of earthquakes, conducted much \noriginal research into magnetism and gravity, and, quite extraordinarily, envisioned the \npossibility of black holes two hundred years before anyone else\u2014a leap of intuitive deduction \nthat not even Newton could make. When the German-born musician William Herschel \ndecided his real interest in life was astronomy, it was Michell to whom he turned for \ninstruction in making telescopes, a kindness for which planetary science has been in his debt \never since.4  \n    But of all that Michell accomplished, nothing was more ingenious or had greater impact \nthan a machine he designed and built for measuring the mass of the Earth. Unfortunately, he \ndied before he could conduct the experiments and both the idea and the necessary equipment \nwere passed on to a brilliant but magnificently retiring London scientist named Henry \nCavendish. \n    Cavendish is a book in himself. Born into a life of sumptuous privilege\u2014his grandfathers \nwere dukes, respectively, of Devonshire and Kent\u2014he was the most gifted English scientist \nof his age, but also the strangest. He suffered, in the words of one of his few biographers, \nfrom shyness to a \u201cdegree bordering on disease.\u201d Any human contact was for him a source of \nthe deepest discomfort. \nOnce he opened his door to find an Austrian admirer, freshly arrived from Vienna, on the \nfront step. Excitedly the Austrian began to babble out praise. For a few moments Cavendish \nreceived the compliments as if they were blows from a blunt object and then, unable to take \nany more, fled down the path and out the gate, leaving the front door wide open. It was some \nhours before he could be coaxed back to the property. Even his housekeeper communicated \nwith him by letter. \nAlthough he did sometimes venture into society\u2014he was particularly devoted to the weekly \nscientific soir\u00e9es of the great naturalist Sir Joseph Banks\u2014it was always made clear to the \nother guests that Cavendish was on no account to be approached or even looked at. Those \nwho sought his views were advised to wander into his vicinity as if by accident and to \u201ctalk as \n                                                 \n4 In 1781 Herschel became the first person in the modern era to discover a planet. He wanted to call it George, \nafter the British monarch, but was overruled. Instead it became Uranus.it were into vacancy.\u201d If their remarks were scientifically worthy they might receive a \nmumbled reply, but more often than not they would hear a peeved squeak (his voice appears \nto have been high pitched) and turn to find an actual vacancy and the sight of Cavendish \nfleeing for a more peaceful corner. \n    His wealth and solitary inclinations allowed him to turn his house in Clapham into a large \nlaboratory where he could range undisturbed through every corner of the physical sciences\u2014\nelectricity, heat, gravity, gases, anything to do with the composition of matter. The second \nhalf of the eighteenth century was a time when people of a scientific bent grew intensely \ninterested in the physical properties of fundamental things\u2014gases and electricity in \nparticular\u2014and began seeing what they could do with them, often with more enthusiasm than \nsense. In America, Benjamin Franklin famously risked his life by flying a kite in an electrical \nstorm. In France, a chemist named Pilatre de Rozier tested the flammability of hydrogen by \ngulping a mouthful and blowing across an open flame, proving at a stroke that hydrogen is \nindeed explosively combustible and that eyebrows are not necessarily a permanent feature of \none\u2019s face. Cavendish, for his part, conducted experiments in which he subjected himself to \ngraduated jolts of electrical current, diligently noting the increasing levels of agony until he \ncould keep hold of his quill, and sometimes his consciousness, no longer. \n    In the course of a long life Cavendish made a string of signal discoveries\u2014among much \nelse he was the first person to isolate hydrogen and the first to combine hydrogen and oxygen \nto form water\u2014but almost nothing he did was entirely divorced from strangeness. To the \ncontinuing exasperation of his fellow scientists, he often alluded in published work to the \nresults of contingent experiments that he had not told anyone about. In his secretiveness he \ndidn\u2019t merely resemble Newton, but actively exceeded him. His experiments with electrical \nconductivity were a century ahead of their time, but unfortunately remained undiscovered \nuntil that century had passed. Indeed the greater part of what he did wasn\u2019t known until the \nlate nineteenth century when the Cambridge physicist James Clerk Maxwell took on the task \nof editing Cavendish\u2019s papers, by which time credit had nearly always been given to others. \n    Among much else, and without telling anyone, Cavendish discovered or anticipated the law \nof the conservation of energy, Ohm\u2019s law, Dalton\u2019s Law of Partial Pressures, Richter\u2019s Law \nof Reciprocal Proportions, Charles\u2019s Law of Gases, and the principles of electrical \nconductivity. That\u2019s just some of it. According to the science historian J. G. Crowther, he also \nforeshadowed \u201cthe work of Kelvin and G. H. Darwin on the effect of tidal friction on slowing \nthe rotation of the earth, and Larmor\u2019s discovery, published in 1915, on the effect of local \natmospheric cooling . . . the work of Pickering on freezing mixtures, and some of the work of \nRooseboom on heterogeneous equilibria.\u201d Finally, he left clues that led directly to the \ndiscovery of the group of elements known as the noble gases, some of which are so elusive \nthat the last of them wasn\u2019t found until 1962. But our interest here is in Cavendish\u2019s last \nknown experiment when in the late summer of 1797, at the age of sixty-seven, he turned his \nattention to the crates of equipment that had been left to him\u2014evidently out of simple \nscientific respect\u2014by John Michell. \n    When assembled, Michell\u2019s apparatus looked like nothing so much as an eighteenth-\ncentury version of a Nautilus weight-training machine. It incorporated weights, \ncounterweights, pendulums, shafts, and torsion wires. At the heart of the machine were two \n350-pound lead balls, which were suspended beside two smaller spheres. The idea was to \nmeasure the gravitational deflection of the smaller spheres by the larger ones, which wouldallow the first measurement of the elusive force known as the gravitational constant, and from \nwhich the weight (strictly speaking, the mass)5 of the Earth could be deduced. \n    Because gravity holds planets in orbit and makes falling objects land with a bang, we tend \nto think of it as a powerful force, but it is not really. It is only powerful in a kind of collective \nsense, when one massive object, like the Sun, holds on to another massive object, like the \nEarth. At an elemental level gravity is extraordinarily unrobust. Each time you pick up a book \nfrom a table or a dime from the floor you effortlessly overcome the combined gravitational \nexertion of an entire planet. What Cavendish was trying to do was measure gravity at this \nextremely featherweight level. \n    Delicacy was the key word. Not a whisper of disturbance could be allowed into the room \ncontaining the apparatus, so Cavendish took up a position in an adjoining room and made his \nobservations with a telescope aimed through a peephole. The work was incredibly exacting \nand involved seventeen delicate, interconnected measurements, which together took nearly a \nyear to complete. When at last he had finished his calculations, Cavendish announced that the \nEarth weighed a little over 13,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds, or six billion trillion \nmetric tons, to use the modern measure. (A metric ton is 1,000 kilograms or 2,205 pounds.) \n    Today, scientists have at their disposal machines so precise they can detect the weight of a \nsingle bacterium and so sensitive that readings can be disturbed by someone yawning seventy-\nfive feet away, but they have not significantly improved on Cavendish\u2019s measurements of \n1797. The current best estimate for Earth\u2019s weight is 5.9725 billion trillion metric tons, a \ndifference of only about 1 percent from Cavendish\u2019s finding. Interestingly, all of this merely \nconfirmed estimates made by Newton 110 years before Cavendish without any experimental \nevidence at all. \n    So, by the late eighteenth century scientists knew very precisely the shape and dimensions \nof the Earth and its distance from the Sun and planets; and now Cavendish, without even \nleaving home, had given them its weight. So you might think that determining the age of the \nEarth would be relatively straightforward. After all, the necessary materials were literally at \ntheir feet. But no. Human beings would split the atom and invent television, nylon, and instant \ncoffee before they could figure out the age of their own planet. \n    To understand why, we must travel north to Scotland and begin with a brilliant and genial \nman, of whom few have ever heard, who had just invented a new science called geology. \n                                                 \n5 To a physicist, mass and weight are two quite different things. Your mass stays the same wherever you go, but \nyour weight varies depending on how far you are from the center of some other massive object like a planet. \nTravel to the Moon and you will be much lighter but no less massive. On Earth, for all practical purposes, mass \nand weight are the same and so the terms can be treated as synonymous. at least outside the classroom.", "5": "5    THE STONE-BREAKERS \nAT JUST THE time that Henry Cavendish was completing his experiments in London, four \nhundred miles away in Edinburgh another kind of concluding moment was about to take place \nwith the death of James Hutton. This was bad news for Hutton, of course, but good news for \nscience as it cleared the way for a man named John Playfair to rewrite Hutton\u2019s work without \nfear of embarrassment. \nHutton was by all accounts a man of the keenest insights and liveliest conversation, a delight \nin company, and without rival when it came to understanding the mysterious slow processes \nthat shaped the Earth. Unfortunately, it was beyond him to set down his notions in a form that \nanyone could begin to understand. He was, as one biographer observed with an all but audible \nsigh, \u201calmost entirely innocent of rhetorical accomplishments.\u201d Nearly every line he penned \nwas an invitation to slumber. Here he is in his 1795 masterwork, A Theory of the Earth with \nProofs and Illustrations , discussing . . . something: \n \n \nThe world which we inhabit is composed of the materials, not of the earth which \nwas the immediate predecessor of the present, but of the earth which, in ascending \nfrom the present, we consider as the third, and which had preceded the land that \nwas above the surface of the sea, while our present land was yet beneath the water \nof the ocean. \n \n    Yet almost singlehandedly, and quite brilliantly, he created the science of geology and \ntransformed our understanding of the Earth. Hutton was born in 1726 into a prosperous \nScottish family, and enjoyed the sort of material comfort that allowed him to pass much of his \nlife in a genially expansive round of light work and intellectual betterment. He studied \nmedicine, but found it not to his liking and turned instead to farming, which he followed in a \nrelaxed and scientific way on the family estate in Berwickshire. Tiring of field and flock, in \n1768 he moved to Edinburgh, where he founded a successful business producing sal \nammoniac from coal soot, and busied himself with various scientific pursuits. Edinburgh at \nthat time was a center of intellectual vigor, and Hutton luxuriated in its enriching possibilities. \nHe became a leading member of a society called the Oyster Club, where he passed his \nevenings in the company of men such as the economist Adam Smith, the chemist Joseph \nBlack, and the philosopher David Hume, as well as such occasional visiting sparks as \nBenjamin Franklin and James Watt. \n    In the tradition of the day, Hutton took an interest in nearly everything, from mineralogy to \nmetaphysics. He conducted experiments with chemicals, investigated methods of coal mining \nand canal building, toured salt mines, speculated on the mechanisms of heredity, collected \nfossils, and propounded theories on rain, the composition of air, and the laws of motion, \namong much else. But his particular interest was geology. \n    Among the questions that attracted interest in that fanatically inquisitive age was one that \nhad puzzled people for a very long time\u2014namely, why ancient clamshells and other marine \nfossils were so often found on mountaintops. How on earth did they get there? Those who \nthought they had a solution fell into two opposing camps. One group, known as the \nNeptunists, was convinced that everything on Earth, including seashells in improbably loftyplaces, could be explained by rising and falling sea levels. They believed that mountains, \nhills, and other features were as old as the Earth itself, and were changed only when water \nsloshed over them during periods of global flooding. \n    Opposing them were the Plutonists, who noted that volcanoes and earthquakes, among \nother enlivening agents, continually changed the face of the planet but clearly owed nothing to \nwayward seas. The Plutonists also raised awkward questions about where all the water went \nwhen it wasn\u2019t in flood. If there was enough of it at times to cover the Alps, then where, pray, \nwas it during times of tranquility, such as now? Their belief was that the Earth was subject to \nprofound internal forces as well as surface ones. However, they couldn\u2019t convincingly explain \nhow all those clamshells got up there. \n    It was while puzzling over these matters that Hutton had a series of exceptional insights. \nFrom looking at his own farmland, he could see that soil was created by the erosion of rocks \nand that particles of this soil were continually washed away and carried off by streams and \nrivers and redeposited elsewhere. He realized that if such a process were carried to its natural \nconclusion then Earth would eventually be worn quite smooth. Yet everywhere around him \nthere were hills. Clearly there had to be some additional process, some form of renewal and \nuplift, that created new hills and mountains to keep the cycle going. The marine fossils on \nmountaintops, he decided, had not been deposited during floods, but had risen along with the \nmountains themselves. He also deduced that it was heat within the Earth that created new \nrocks and continents and thrust up mountain chains. It is not too much to say that geologists \nwouldn\u2019t grasp the full implications of this thought for two hundred years, when finally they \nadopted plate tectonics. Above all, what Hutton\u2019s theories suggested was that Earth processes \nrequired huge amounts of time, far more than anyone had ever dreamed. There were enough \ninsights here to transform utterly our understanding of the Earth. \n    In 1785, Hutton worked his ideas up into a long paper, which was read at consecutive \nmeetings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. It attracted almost no notice at all. It\u2019s not hard \nto see why. Here, in part, is how he presented it to his audience: \n \n     \nIn the one case, the forming cause is in the body which is separated; for, after the \nbody has been actuated by heat, it is by the reaction of the proper matter of the \nbody, that the chasm which constitutes the vein is formed. In the other case, again, \nthe cause is extrinsic in relation to the body in which the chasm is formed. There \nhas been the most violent fracture and divulsion; but the cause is still to seek; and \nit appears not in the vein; for it is not every fracture and dislocation of the solid \nbody of our earth, in which minerals, or the proper substances of mineral veins, \nare found. \n \n    Needless to say, almost no one in the audience had the faintest idea what he was talking \nabout. Encouraged by his friends to expand his theory, in the touching hope that he might \nsomehow stumble onto clarity in a more expansive format, Hutton spent the next ten years \npreparing his magnum opus, which was published in two volumes in 1795. \n    Together the two books ran to nearly a thousand pages and were, remarkably, worse than \neven his most pessimistic friends had feared. Apart from anything else, nearly half thecompleted work now consisted of quotations from French sources, still in the original French.     \nA third volume was so unenticing that it wasn\u2019t published until 1899, more than a century \nafter Hutton\u2019s death, and the fourth and concluding volume was never published at all. \nHutton\u2019s Theory of the Earth is a strong candidate for the least read important book in science \n(or at least would be if there weren\u2019t so many others). Even Charles Lyell, the greatest \ngeologist of the following century and a man who read everything, admitted he couldn\u2019t get \nthrough it. \n    Luckily Hutton had a Boswell in the form of John Playfair, a professor of mathematics at \nthe University of Edinburgh and a close friend, who could not only write silken prose but\u2014\nthanks to many years at Hutton\u2019s elbow\u2014actually understood what Hutton was trying to say, \nmost of the time. In 1802, five years after Hutton\u2019s death, Playfair produced a simplified \nexposition of the Huttonian principles, entitled Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the \nEarth. The book was gratefully received by those who took an active interest in geology, \nwhich in 1802 was not a large number. That, however, was about to change. And how. \n  \n    In the winter of 1807, thirteen like-minded souls in London got together at the Freemasons \nTavern at Long Acre, in Covent Garden, to form a dining club to be called the Geological \nSociety. The idea was to meet once a month to swap geological notions over a glass or two of \nMadeira and a convivial dinner. The price of the meal was set at a deliberately hefty fifteen \nshillings to discourage those whose qualifications were merely cerebral. It soon became \napparent, however, that there was a demand for something more properly institutional, with a \npermanent headquarters, where people could gather to share and discuss new findings. In \nbarely a decade membership grew to four hundred\u2014still all gentlemen, of course\u2014and the \nGeological was threatening to eclipse the Royal as the premier scientific society in the \ncountry. \n    The members met twice a month from November until June, when virtually all of them \nwent off to spend the summer doing fieldwork. These weren\u2019t people with a pecuniary interest \nin minerals, you understand, or even academics for the most part, but simply gentlemen with \nthe wealth and time to indulge a hobby at a more or less professional level. By 1830, there \nwere 745 of them, and the world would never see the like again. \n    It is hard to imagine now, but geology excited the nineteenth century\u2014positively gripped \nit\u2014in a way that no science ever had before or would again. In 1839, when Roderick \nMurchison published The Silurian System, a plump and ponderous study of a type of rock \ncalled greywacke, it was an instant bestseller, racing through four editions, even though it cost \neight guineas a copy and was, in true Huttonian style, unreadable. (As even a Murchison \nsupporter conceded, it had \u201ca total want of literary attractiveness.\u201d) And when, in 1841, the \ngreat Charles Lyell traveled to America to give a series of lectures in Boston, sellout \naudiences of three thousand at a time packed into the Lowell Institute to hear his tranquilizing \ndescriptions of marine zeolites and seismic perturbations in Campania. \n    Throughout the modern, thinking world, but especially in Britain, men of learning ventured \ninto the countryside to do a little \u201cstone-breaking,\u201d as they called it. It was a pursuit taken \nseriously, and they tended to dress with appropriate gravity, in top hats and dark suits, except \nfor the Reverend William Buckland of Oxford, whose habit it was to do his fieldwork in an \nacademic gown.The field attracted many extraordinary figures, not least the aforementioned Murchison, \nwho spent the first thirty or so years of his life galloping after foxes, converting aeronautically \nchallenged birds into puffs of drifting feathers with buckshot, and showing no mental agility \nwhatever beyond that needed to read The Times or play a hand of cards. Then he discovered \nan interest in rocks and became with rather astounding swiftness a titan of geological \nthinking. \n    Then there was Dr. James Parkinson, who was also an early socialist and author of many \nprovocative pamphlets with titles like \u201cRevolution without Bloodshed.\u201d In 1794, he was \nimplicated in a faintly lunatic-sounding conspiracy called \u201cthe Pop-gun Plot,\u201d in which it was \nplanned to shoot King George III in the neck with a poisoned dart as he sat in his box at the \ntheater. Parkinson was hauled before the Privy Council for questioning and came within an \nace of being dispatched in irons to Australia before the charges against him were quietly \ndropped. Adopting a more conservative approach to life, he developed an interest in geology \nand became one of the founding members of the Geological Society and the author of an \nimportant geological text, Organic Remains of a Former World, which remained in print for \nhalf a century. He never caused trouble again. Today, however, we remember him for his \nlandmark study of the affliction then called the \u201cshaking palsy,\u201d but known ever since as \nParkinson\u2019s disease. (Parkinson had one other slight claim to fame. In 1785, he became \npossibly the only person in history to win a natural history museum in a raffle. The museum, \nin London\u2019s Leicester Square, had been founded by Sir Ashton Lever, who had driven himself \nbankrupt with his unrestrained collecting of natural wonders. Parkinson kept the museum until \n1805, when he could no longer support it and the collection was broken up and sold.) \n    Not quite as remarkable in character but more influential than all the others combined was \nCharles Lyell. Lyell was born in the year that Hutton died and only seventy miles away, in the \nvillage of Kinnordy. Though Scottish by birth, he grew up in the far south of England, in the \nNew Forest of Hampshire, because his mother was convinced that Scots were feckless drunks. \nAs was generally the pattern with nineteenth-century gentlemen scientists, Lyell came from a \nbackground of comfortable wealth and intellectual vigor. His father, also named Charles, had \nthe unusual distinction of being a leading authority on the poet Dante and on mosses. \n(Orthotricium lyelli, which most visitors to the English countryside will at some time have sat \non, is named for him.) From his father Lyell gained an interest in natural history, but it was at \nOxford, where he fell under the spell of the Reverend William Buckland\u2014he of the flowing \ngowns\u2014that the young Lyell began his lifelong devotion to geology. \n    Buckland was a bit of a charming oddity. He had some real achievements, but he is \nremembered at least as much for his eccentricities. He was particularly noted for a menagerie \nof wild animals, some large and dangerous, that were allowed to roam through his house and \ngarden, and for his desire to eat his way through every animal in creation. Depending on \nwhim and availability, guests to Buckland\u2019s house might be served baked guinea pig, mice in \nbatter, roasted hedgehog, or boiled Southeast Asian sea slug. Buckland was able to find merit \nin them all, except the common garden mole, which he declared disgusting. Almost \ninevitably, he became the leading authority on coprolites\u2014fossilized feces\u2014and had a table \nmade entirely out of his collection of specimens. \n    Even when conducting serious science his manner was generally singular. Once Mrs. \nBuckland found herself being shaken awake in the middle of the night, her husband crying in \nexcitement: \u201cMy dear, I believe that Cheirotherium \u2019s footsteps are undoubtedly testudinal.\u201d \nTogether they hurried to the kitchen in their nightclothes. Mrs. Buckland made a flour paste, \nwhich she spread across the table, while the Reverend Buckland fetched the family tortoise.Plunking it onto the paste, they goaded it forward and discovered to their delight that its \nfootprints did indeed match those of the fossil Buckland had been studying. Charles Darwin \nthought Buckland a buffoon\u2014that was the word he used\u2014but Lyell appeared to find him \ninspiring and liked him well enough to go touring with him in Scotland in 1824. It was soon \nafter this trip that Lyell decided to abandon a career in law and devote himself to geology full-\ntime. \n    Lyell was extremely shortsighted and went through most of his life with a pained squint, \nwhich gave him a troubled air. (Eventually he would lose his sight altogether.) His other slight \npeculiarity was the habit, when distracted by thought, of taking up improbable positions on \nfurniture\u2014lying across two chairs at once or \u201cresting his head on the seat of a chair, while \nstanding up\u201d (to quote his friend Darwin). Often when lost in thought he would slink so low \nin a chair that his buttocks would all but touch the floor. Lyell\u2019s only real job in life was as \nprofessor of geology at King\u2019s College in London from 1831 to 1833. It was around this time \nthat he produced The Principles of Geology, published in three volumes between 1830 and \n1833, which in many ways consolidated and elaborated upon the thoughts first voiced by \nHutton a generation earlier. (Although Lyell never read Hutton in the original, he was a keen \nstudent of Playfair\u2019s reworked version.) \n    Between Hutton\u2019s day and Lyell\u2019s there arose a new geological controversy, which largely \nsuperseded, but is often confused with, the old Neptunian\u2013Plutonian dispute. The new battle \nbecame an argument between catastrophism and uniformitarianism\u2014unattractive terms for an \nimportant and very long-running dispute. Catastrophists, as you might expect from the name, \nbelieved that the Earth was shaped by abrupt cataclysmic events\u2014floods principally, which is \nwhy catastrophism and neptunism are often wrongly bundled together. Catastrophism was \nparticularly comforting to clerics like Buckland because it allowed them to incorporate the \nbiblical flood of Noah into serious scientific discussions. Uniformitarians by contrast believed \nthat changes on Earth were gradual and that nearly all Earth processes happened slowly, over \nimmense spans of time. Hutton was much more the father of the notion than Lyell, but it was \nLyell most people read, and so he became in most people\u2019s minds, then and now, the father of \nmodern geological thought. \n    Lyell believed that the Earth\u2019s shifts were uniform and steady\u2014that everything that had \never happened in the past could be explained by events still going on today. Lyell and his \nadherents didn\u2019t just disdain catastrophism, they detested it. Catastrophists believed that \nextinctions were part of a series in which animals were repeatedly wiped out and replaced \nwith new sets\u2014a belief that the naturalist T. H. Huxley mockingly likened to \u201ca succession of \nrubbers of whist, at the end of which the players upset the table and called for a new pack.\u201d It \nwas too convenient a way to explain the unknown. \u201cNever was there a dogma more calculated \nto foster indolence, and to blunt the keen edge of curiosity,\u201d sniffed Lyell. \n    Lyell\u2019s oversights were not inconsiderable. He failed to explain convincingly how \nmountain ranges were formed and overlooked glaciers as an agent of change. He refused to \naccept Louis Agassiz\u2019s idea of ice ages\u2014\u201cthe refrigeration of the globe,\u201d as he dismissively \ntermed it\u2014and was confident that mammals \u201cwould be found in the oldest fossiliferous \nbeds.\u201d He rejected the notion that animals and plants suffered sudden annihilations, and \nbelieved that all the principal animal groups\u2014mammals, reptiles, fish, and so on\u2014had \ncoexisted since the dawn of time. On all of these he would ultimately be proved wrong. \n    Yet it would be nearly impossible to overstate Lyell\u2019s influence. The Principles of Geology \nwent through twelve editions in Lyell\u2019s lifetime and contained notions that shaped geologicalthinking far into the twentieth century. Darwin took a first edition with him on theBeagle \nvoyage and wrote afterward that \u201cthe great merit of the Principles was that it altered the \nwhole tone of one\u2019s mind, and therefore that, when seeing a thing never seen by Lyell, one yet \nsaw it partially through his eyes.\u201d In short, he thought him nearly a god, as did many of his \ngeneration. It is a testament to the strength of Lyell\u2019s sway that in the 1980s when geologists \nhad to abandon just a part of it to accommodate the impact theory of extinctions, it nearly \nkilled them. But that is another chapter. \n    Meanwhile, geology had a great deal of sorting out to do, and not all of it went smoothly. \nFrom the outset geologists tried to categorize rocks by the periods in which they were laid \ndown, but there were often bitter disagreements about where to put the dividing lines\u2014none \nmore so than a long-running debate that became known as the Great Devonian Controversy. \nThe issue arose when the Reverend Adam Sedgwick of Cambridge claimed for the Cambrian \nperiod a layer of rock that Roderick Murchison believed belonged rightly to the Silurian. The \ndispute raged for years and grew extremely heated. \u201cDe la Beche is a dirty dog,\u201d Murchison \nwrote to a friend in a typical outburst. \n    Some sense of the strength of feeling can be gained by glancing through the chapter titles \nof Martin J. S. Rudwick\u2019s excellent and somber account of the issue, The Great Devonian \nControversy. These begin innocuously enough with headings such as \u201cArenas of Gentlemanly \nDebate\u201d and \u201cUnraveling the Greywacke,\u201d but then proceed on to \u201cThe Greywacke Defended \nand Attacked,\u201d \u201cReproofs and Recriminations,\u201d \u201cThe Spread of Ugly Rumors,\u201d \u201cWeaver \nRecants His Heresy,\u201d \u201cPutting a Provincial in His Place,\u201d and (in case there was any doubt \nthat this was war) \u201cMurchison Opens the Rhineland Campaign.\u201d The fight was finally settled \nin 1879 with the simple expedient of coming up with a new period, the Ordovician, to be \ninserted between the two. \n    Because the British were the most active in the early years, British names are predominant \nin the geological lexicon. Devonian is of course from the English county of Devon. Cambrian \ncomes from the Roman name for Wales, while Ordovician and Silurian recall ancient Welsh \ntribes, the Ordovices and Silures. But with the rise of geological prospecting elsewhere, \nnames began to creep in from all over.Jurassic refers to the Jura Mountains on the border of \nFrance and Switzerland.Permian recalls the former Russian province of Perm in the Ural \nMountains. ForCretaceous (from the Latin for \u201cchalk\u201d) we are indebted to a Belgian geologist \nwith the perky name of J. J. d\u2019Omalius d\u2019Halloy. \n    Originally, geological history was divided into four spans of time: primary, secondary, \ntertiary, and quaternary. The system was too neat to last, and soon geologists were \ncontributing additional divisions while eliminating others. Primary and secondary fell out of \nuse altogether, while quaternary was discarded by some but kept by others. Today only \ntertiary remains as a common designation everywhere, even though it no longer represents a \nthird period of anything. \n    Lyell, in his Principles, introduced additional units known as epochs or series to cover the \nperiod since the age of the dinosaurs, among them Pleistocene (\u201cmost recent\u201d), Pliocene \n(\u201cmore recent\u201d), Miocene (\u201cmoderately recent\u201d), and the rather endearingly vague Oligocene \n(\u201cbut a little recent\u201d). Lyell originally intended to employ \u201c-synchronous\u201d for his endings, \ngiving us such crunchy designations as Meiosynchronous and Pleiosynchronous. The \nReverend William Whewell, an influential man, objected on etymological grounds and \nsuggested instead an \u201c-eous\u201d pattern, producing Meioneous, Pleioneous, and so on. The \u201c-\ncene\u201d terminations were thus something of a compromise.Nowadays, and speaking very generally, geological time is divided first into four great \nchunks known as eras: Precambrian, Paleozoic (from the Greek meaning \u201cold life\u201d), \nMesozoic (\u201cmiddle life\u201d), and Cenozoic (\u201crecent life\u201d). These four eras are further divided \ninto anywhere from a dozen to twenty subgroups, usually called periods though sometimes \nknown as systems. Most of these are also reasonably well known: Cretaceous, Jurassic, \nTriassic, Silurian, and so on.1  \n    Then come Lyell\u2019s epochs\u2014the Pleistocene, Miocene, and so on\u2014which apply only to the \nmost recent (but paleontologically busy) sixty-five million years, and finally we have a mass \nof finer subdivisions known as stages or ages. Most of these are named, nearly always \nawkwardly, after places: Illinoian, Desmoinesian, Croixian, Kimmeridgian, and so on in like \nvein. Altogether, according to John McPhee, these number in the \u201ctens of dozens.\u201d \nFortunately, unless you take up geology as a career, you are unlikely ever to hear any of them \nagain. \n    Further confusing the matter is that the stages or ages in North America have different \nnames from the stages in Europe and often only roughly intersect in time. Thus the North \nAmerican Cincinnatian stage mostly corresponds with the Ashgillian stage in Europe, plus a \ntiny bit of the slightly earlier Caradocian stage. \n    Also, all this changes from textbook to textbook and from person to person, so that some \nauthorities describe seven recent epochs, while others are content with four. In some books, \ntoo, you will find the tertiary and quaternary taken out and replaced by periods of different \nlengths called the Palaeogene and Neogene. Others divide the Precambrian into two eras, the \nvery ancient Archean and the more recent Proterozoic. Sometimes too you will see the term \nPhanerozoic used to describe the span encompassing the Cenozoic, Mesozoic, and Paleozoic \neras. \n    Moreover, all this applies only to units of time . Rocks are divided into quite separate units \nknown as systems, series, and stages. A distinction is also made between late and early \n(referring to time) and upper and lower (referring to layers of rock). It can all get terribly \nconfusing to nonspecialists, but to a geologist these can be matters of passion. \u201cI have seen \ngrown men glow incandescent with rage over this metaphorical millisecond in life\u2019s history,\u201d \nthe British paleontologist Richard Fortey has written with regard to a long-running twentieth-\ncentury dispute over where the boundary lies between the Cambrian and Ordovician. \n    At least today we can bring some sophisticated dating techniques to the table. For most of \nthe nineteenth century geologists could draw on nothing more than the most hopeful \nguesswork. The frustrating position then was that although they could place the various rocks \nand fossils in order by age, they had no idea how long any of those ages were. When \nBuckland speculated on the antiquity of an Ichthyosaurus skeleton he could do no better than \nsuggest that it had lived somewhere between \u201cten thousand, or more than ten thousand times \nten thousand\u201d years earlier. \n    Although there was no reliable way of dating periods, there was no shortage of people \nwilling to try. The most well known early attempt was in 1650 when Archbishop James \nUssher of the Church of Ireland made a careful study of the Bible and other historical sources \nand concluded, in a hefty tome called Annals of the Old Testament , that the Earth had been \n                                                 \n1 There will be no testing here, but if you are ever required to memorize them you might wish to remember John \nWilford's helpful advice to think of the eras (Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, an( Cenozoic) as seasons in a \nyear and the periods (Permian, Triassic Jurassic, etc.) as the months.created at midday on October 23, 4004B.C. , an assertion that has amused historians and \ntextbook writers ever since.2  \n    There is a persistent myth, incidentally\u2014and one propounded in many serious books\u2014that \nUssher\u2019s views dominated scientific beliefs well into the nineteenth century, and that it was \nLyell who put everyone straight. Stephen Jay Gould, in Time\u2019s Arrow, cites as a typical \nexample this sentence from a popular book of the 1980s: \u201cUntil Lyell published his book, \nmost thinking people accepted the idea that the earth was young.\u201d In fact, no. As Martin J. S. \nRudwick puts it, \u201cNo geologist of any nationality whose work was taken seriously by other \ngeologists advocated a timescale confined within the limits of a literalistic exegesis of \nGenesis.\u201d Even the Reverend Buckland, as pious a soul as the nineteenth century produced, \nnoted that nowhere did the Bible suggest that God made Heaven and Earth on the first day, \nbut merely \u201cin the beginning.\u201d That beginning, he reasoned, may have lasted \u201cmillions upon \nmillions of years.\u201d Everyone agreed that the Earth was ancient. The question was simply how \nancient. \n    One of the better early attempts at dating the planet came from the ever-reliable Edmond \nHalley, who in 1715 suggested that if you divided the total amount of salt in the world\u2019s seas \nby the amount added each year, you would get the number of years that the oceans had been \nin existence, which would give you a rough idea of Earth\u2019s age. The logic was appealing, but \nunfortunately no one knew how much salt was in the sea or by how much it increased each \nyear, which rendered the experiment impracticable. \n    The first attempt at measurement that could be called remotely scientific was made by the \nFrenchman Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, in the 1770s. It had long been known \nthat the Earth radiated appreciable amounts of heat\u2014that was apparent to anyone who went \ndown a coal mine\u2014but there wasn\u2019t any way of estimating the rate of dissipation. Buffon\u2019s \nexperiment consisted of heating spheres until they glowed white hot and then estimating the \nrate of heat loss by touching them (presumably very lightly at first) as they cooled. From this \nhe guessed the Earth\u2019s age to be somewhere between 75,000 and 168,000 years old. This was \nof course a wild underestimate, but a radical notion nonetheless, and Buffon found himself \nthreatened with excommunication for expressing it. A practical man, he apologized at once \nfor his thoughtless heresy, then cheerfully repeated the assertions throughout his subsequent \nwritings. \n    By the middle of the nineteenth century most learned people thought the Earth was at least \na few million years old, perhaps even some tens of millions of years old, but probably not \nmore than that. So it came as a surprise when, in 1859 in On the Origin of Species , Charles \nDarwin announced that the geological processes that created the Weald, an area of southern \nEngland stretching across Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, had taken, by his calculations, \n306,662,400 years to complete. The assertion was remarkable partly for being so arrestingly \nspecific but even more for flying in the face of accepted wisdom about the age of the Earth.3 It \nproved so contentious that Darwin withdrew it from the third edition of the book. The \n                                                 \n2 Although virtually all books find a space for him, there is a striking variability in the details associated with \nUssher. Some books say he made his pronouncement in 1650, others in 1654, still others in 1664. Many cite the \ndate of Earth's reputed beginning as October 26. At least one book of note spells his name \"Usher.\" The matter is \ninterestingly surveyed in Stephen Jay Gould's Eight Little Piggies. \n3 Darwin loved an exact number. In a later work, he announced that the number of worms to be found in an \naverage acre of English country soil was 53,767.problem at its heart remained, however. Darwin and his geological friends needed the Earth to \nbe old, but no one could figure out a way to make it so. \n  \n    Unfortunately for Darwin, and for progress, the question came to the attention of the great \nLord Kelvin (who, though indubitably great, was then still just plain William Thomson; he \nwouldn\u2019t be elevated to the peerage until 1892, when he was sixty-eight years old and nearing \nthe end of his career, but I shall follow the convention here of using the name retroactively). \nKelvin was one of the most extraordinary figures of the nineteenth century\u2014indeed of any \ncentury. The German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz, no intellectual slouch himself, wrote \nthat Kelvin had by far the greatest \u201cintelligence and lucidity, and mobility of thought\u201d of any \nman he had ever met. \u201cI felt quite wooden beside him sometimes,\u201d he added, a bit dejectedly. \n    The sentiment is understandable, for Kelvin really was a kind of Victorian superman. He \nwas born in 1824 in Belfast, the son of a professor of mathematics at the Royal Academical \nInstitution who soon after transferred to Glasgow. There Kelvin proved himself such a \nprodigy that he was admitted to Glasgow University at the exceedingly tender age of ten. By \nthe time he had reached his early twenties, he had studied at institutions in London and Paris, \ngraduated from Cambridge (where he won the university\u2019s top prizes for rowing and \nmathematics, and somehow found time to launch a musical society as well), been elected a \nfellow of Peterhouse, and written (in French and English) a dozen papers in pure and applied \nmathematics of such dazzling originality that he had to publish them anonymously for fear of \nembarrassing his superiors. At the age of twenty-two he returned to Glasgow University to \ntake up a professorship in natural philosophy, a position he would hold for the next fifty-three \nyears. \n    In the course of a long career (he lived till 1907 and the age of eighty-three), he wrote 661 \npapers, accumulated 69 patents (from which he grew abundantly wealthy), and gained renown \nin nearly every branch of the physical sciences. Among much else, he suggested the method \nthat led directly to the invention of refrigeration, devised the scale of absolute temperature \nthat still bears his name, invented the boosting devices that allowed telegrams to be sent \nacross oceans, and made innumerable improvements to shipping and navigation, from the \ninvention of a popular marine compass to the creation of the first depth sounder. And those \nwere merely his practical achievements. \n    His theoretical work, in electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and the wave theory of light, \nwas equally revolutionary.4 He had really only one flaw and that was an inability to calculate \nthe correct age of the Earth. The question occupied much of the second half of his career, but \nhe never came anywhere near getting it right. His first effort, in 1862 for an article in a \npopular magazine called Macmillan\u2019s , suggested that the Earth was 98 million years old, but \ncautiously allowed that the figure could be as low as 20 million years or as high as 400 \nmillion. With remarkable prudence he acknowledged that his calculations could be wrong if \n                                                 \n4 In particular he elaborated the Second Law of Thermodynamics. A discussion of these laws would be a book in \nitself, but I offer here this crisp summation by the chemist P. W Atkins, just to provide a sense of them: \"There \nare four Laws. The third of them, the Second Law, was recognized first; the first, the Zeroth Law, was \nformulated last; the First Law was second; the Third Law might not even be a law in the same sense as the \nothers.\" In briefest terms, the second la\\\\ states that a little energy is always wasted. You can't have a perpetual \nmotion device because no matter how efficient, it will always lose energy and eventually run down. The first law \nsays that you can't create energy and the third that you can't reduce temperatures to absolute zero; there will \nalways be some residual warmth. As Dennis Overbye notes, the three principal laws are sometimes expressed \njocularly as (1) you can't win, (2) you can't break even, and (3) you can't get out of the game.\u201csources now unknown to us are prepared in the great storehouse of creation\u201d\u2014but it was \nclear that he thought that unlikely. \n    With the passage of time Kelvin would become more forthright in his assertions and less \ncorrect. He continually revised his estimates downward, from a maximum of 400 million \nyears, to 100 million years, to 50 million years, and finally, in 1897, to a mere 24 million \nyears. Kelvin wasn\u2019t being willful. It was simply that there was nothing in physics that could \nexplain how a body the size of the Sun could burn continuously for more than a few tens of \nmillions of years at most without exhausting its fuel. Therefore it followed that the Sun and its \nplanets were relatively, but inescapably, youthful. \n    The problem was that nearly all the fossil evidence contradicted this, and suddenly in the \nnineteenth century there was a lot of fossil evidence.", "6": "6    SCIENCE RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW \nIN 1787, SOMEONE in New Jersey\u2014exactly who now seems to be forgotten\u2014found an \nenormous thighbone sticking out of a stream bank at a place called Woodbury Creek. The \nbone clearly didn\u2019t belong to any species of creature still alive, certainly not in New Jersey. \nFrom what little is known now, it is thought to have belonged to a hadrosaur, a large duck-\nbilled dinosaur. At the time, dinosaurs were unknown. \n    The bone was sent to Dr. Caspar Wistar, the nation\u2019s leading anatomist, who described it at \na meeting of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia that autumn. Unfortunately, \nWistar failed completely to recognize the bone\u2019s significance and merely made a few cautious \nand uninspired remarks to the effect that it was indeed a whopper. He thus missed the chance, \nhalf a century ahead of anyone else, to be the discoverer of dinosaurs. Indeed, the bone \nexcited so little interest that it was put in a storeroom and eventually disappeared altogether. \nSo the first dinosaur bone ever found was also the first to be lost. \n    That the bone didn\u2019t attract greater interest is more than a little puzzling, for its appearance \ncame at a time when America was in a froth of excitement about the remains of large, ancient \nanimals. The cause of this froth was a strange assertion by the great French naturalist the \nComte de Buffon\u2014he of the heated spheres from the previous chapter\u2014that living things in \nthe New World were inferior in nearly every way to those of the Old World. America, Buffon \nwrote in his vast and much-esteemed Histoire Naturelle , was a land where the water was \nstagnant, the soil unproductive, and the animals without size or vigor, their constitutions \nweakened by the \u201cnoxious vapors\u201d that rose from its rotting swamps and sunless forests. In \nsuch an environment even the native Indians lacked virility. \u201cThey have no beard or body \nhair,\u201d Buffon sagely confided, \u201cand no ardor for the female.\u201d Their reproductive organs were \n\u201csmall and feeble.\u201d \n    Buffon\u2019s observations found surprisingly eager support among other writers, especially \nthose whose conclusions were not complicated by actual familiarity with the country. A \nDutchman named Comeille de Pauw announced in a popular work called Recherches \nPhilosophiques sur les Am\u00e9ricains that native American males were not only reproductively \nunimposing, but \u201cso lacking in virility that they had milk in their breasts.\u201d Such views \nenjoyed an improbable durability and could be found repeated or echoed in European texts till \nnear the end of the nineteenth century. \n    Not surprisingly, such aspersions were indignantly met in America. Thomas Jefferson \nincorporated a furious (and, unless the context is understood, quite bewildering) rebuttal in his \nNotes on the State of Virginia , and induced his New Hampshire friend General John Sullivan \nto send twenty soldiers into the northern woods to find a bull moose to present to Buffon as \nproof of the stature and majesty of American quadrupeds. It took the men two weeks to track \ndown a suitable subject. The moose, when shot, unfortunately lacked the imposing horns that \nJefferson had specified, but Sullivan thoughtfully included a rack of antlers from an elk or \nstag with the suggestion that these be attached instead. Who in France, after all, would know? \n    Meanwhile in Philadelphia\u2014Wistar\u2019s city\u2014naturalists had begun to assemble the bones of \na giant elephant-like creature known at first as \u201cthe great American incognitum\u201d but later \nidentified, not quite correctly, as a mammoth. The first of these bones had been discovered at \na place called Big Bone Lick in Kentucky, but soon others were turning up all over. America, \nit appeared, had once been the home of a truly substantial creature\u2014one that would surely \ndisprove Buffon\u2019s foolish Gallic contentions.In their keenness to demonstrate the incognitum\u2019s bulk and ferocity, the American \nnaturalists appear to have become slightly carried away. They overestimated its size by a \nfactor of six and gave it frightening claws, which in fact came from a Megalonyx, or giant \nground sloth, found nearby. Rather remarkably, they persuaded themselves that the animal \nhad enjoyed \u201cthe agility and ferocity of the tiger,\u201d and portrayed it in illustrations as pouncing \nwith feline grace onto prey from boulders. When tusks were discovered, they were forced into \nthe animal\u2019s head in any number of inventive ways. One restorer screwed the tusks in upside \ndown, like the fangs of a saber-toothed cat, which gave it a satisfyingly aggressive aspect. \nAnother arranged the tusks so that they curved backwards on the engaging theory that the \ncreature had been aquatic and had used them to anchor itself to trees while dozing. The most \npertinent consideration about the incognitum, however, was that it appeared to be extinct\u2014a \nfact that Buffon cheerfully seized upon as proof of its incontestably degenerate nature. \n    Buffon died in 1788, but the controversy rolled on. In 1795 a selection of bones made their \nway to Paris, where they were examined by the rising star of paleontology, the youthful and \naristocratic Georges Cuvier. Cuvier was already dazzling people with his genius for taking \nheaps of disarticulated bones and whipping them into shapely forms. It was said that he could \ndescribe the look and nature of an animal from a single tooth or scrap of jaw, and often name \nthe species and genus into the bargain. Realizing that no one in America had thought to write \na formal description of the lumbering beast, Cuvier did so, and thus became its official \ndiscoverer. He called it a mastodon (which means, a touch unexpectedly, \u201cnipple-teeth\u201d). \n    Inspired by the controversy, in 1796 Cuvier wrote a landmark paper, Note on the Species of \nLiving and Fossil Elephants, in which he put forward for the first time a formal theory of \nextinctions. His belief was that from time to time the Earth experienced global catastrophes in \nwhich groups of creatures were wiped out. For religious people, including Cuvier himself, the \nidea raised uncomfortable implications since it suggested an unaccountable casualness on the \npart of Providence. To what end would God create species only to wipe them out later? The \nnotion was contrary to the belief in the Great Chain of Being, which held that the world was \ncarefully ordered and that every living thing within it had a place and purpose, and always had \nand always would. Jefferson for one couldn\u2019t abide the thought that whole species would ever \nbe permitted to vanish (or, come to that, to evolve). So when it was put to him that there \nmight be scientific and political value in sending a party to explore the interior of America \nbeyond the Mississippi he leapt at the idea, hoping the intrepid adventurers would find herds \nof healthy mastodons and other outsized creatures grazing on the bounteous plains. \nJefferson\u2019s personal secretary and trusted friend Meriwether Lewis was chosen co-leader and \nchief naturalist for the expedition. The person selected to advise him on what to look out for \nwith regard to animals living and deceased was none other than Caspar Wistar. \n  \n    In the same year\u2014in fact, the same month\u2014that the aristocratic and celebrated Cuvier was \npropounding his extinction theories in Paris, on the other side of the English Channel a rather \nmore obscure Englishman was having an insight into the value of fossils that would also have \nlasting ramifications. William Smith was a young supervisor of construction on the Somerset \nCoal Canal. On the evening of January 5, 1796, he was sitting in a coaching inn in Somerset \nwhen he jotted down the notion that would eventually make his reputation. To interpret rocks, \nthere needs to be some means of correlation, a basis on which you can tell that those \ncarboniferous rocks from Devon are younger than these Cambrian rocks from Wales. Smith\u2019s \ninsight was to realize that the answer lay with fossils. At every change in rock strata certain \nspecies of fossils disappeared while others carried on into subsequent levels. By noting whichspecies appeared in which strata, you could work out the relative ages of rocks wherever they \nappeared. Drawing on his knowledge as a surveyor, Smith began at once to make a map of \nBritain\u2019s rock strata, which would be published after many trials in 1815 and would become a \ncornerstone of modern geology. (The story is comprehensively covered in Simon \nWinchester\u2019s popular book The Map That Changed the World .) \n    Unfortunately, having had his insight, Smith was curiously uninterested in understanding \nwhy rocks were laid down in the way they were. \u201cI have left off puzzling about the origin of \nStrata and content myself with knowing that it is so,\u201d he recorded. \u201cThe whys and wherefores \ncannot come within the Province of a Mineral Surveyor.\u201d \n    Smith\u2019s revelation regarding strata heightened the moral awkwardness concerning \nextinctions. To begin with, it confirmed that God had wiped out creatures not occasionally but \nrepeatedly. This made Him seem not so much careless as peculiarly hostile. It also made it \ninconveniently necessary to explain how some species were wiped out while others continued \nunimpeded into succeeding eons. Clearly there was more to extinctions than could be \naccounted for by a single Noachian deluge, as the Biblical flood was known. Cuvier resolved \nthe matter to his own satisfaction by suggesting that Genesis applied only to the most recent \ninundation. God, it appeared, hadn\u2019t wished to distract or alarm Moses with news of earlier, \nirrelevant extinctions. \n    So by the early years of the nineteenth century, fossils had taken on a certain inescapable \nimportance, which makes Wistar\u2019s failure to see the significance of his dinosaur bone all the \nmore unfortunate. Suddenly, in any case, bones were turning up all over. Several other \nopportunities arose for Americans to claim the discovery of dinosaurs but all were wasted. In \n1806 the Lewis and Clark expedition passed through the Hell Creek formation in Montana, an \narea where fossil hunters would later literally trip over dinosaur bones, and even examined \nwhat was clearly a dinosaur bone embedded in rock, but failed to make anything of it. Other \nbones and fossilized footprints were found in the Connecticut River Valley of New England \nafter a farm boy named Plinus Moody spied ancient tracks on a rock ledge at South Hadley, \nMassachusetts. Some of these at least survive\u2014notably the bones of an Anchisaurus, which \nare in the collection of the Peabody Museum at Yale. Found in 1818, they were the first \ndinosaur bones to be examined and saved, but unfortunately weren\u2019t recognized for what they \nwere until 1855. In that same year, 1818, Caspar Wistar died, but he did gain a certain \nunexpected immortality when a botanist named Thomas Nuttall named a delightful climbing \nshrub after him. Some botanical purists still insist on spelling it wistaria . \n  \n    By this time, however, paleontological momentum had moved to England. In 1812, at \nLyme Regis on the Dorset coast, an extraordinary child named Mary Anning\u2014aged eleven, \ntwelve, or thirteen, depending on whose account you read\u2014found a strange fossilized sea \nmonster, seventeen feet long and now known as the ichthyosaurus, embedded in the steep and \ndangerous cliffs along the English Channel. \n    It was the start of a remarkable career. Anning would spend the next thirty-five years \ngathering fossils, which she sold to visitors. (She is commonly held to be the source for the \nfamous tongue twister \u201cShe sells seashells on the seashore.\u201d) She would also find the first \nplesiosaurus, another marine monster, and one of the first and best pterodactyls. Though none \nof these was technically a dinosaur, that wasn\u2019t terribly relevant at the time since nobody thenknew what a dinosaur was. It was enough to realize that the world had once held creatures \nstrikingly unlike anything we might now find. \n    It wasn\u2019t simply that Anning was good at spotting fossils\u2014though she was unrivalled at \nthat\u2014but that she could extract them with the greatest delicacy and without damage. If you \never have the chance to visit the hall of ancient marine reptiles at the Natural History Museum \nin London, I urge you to take it for there is no other way to appreciate the scale and beauty of \nwhat this young woman achieved working virtually unaided with the most basic tools in \nnearly impossible conditions. The plesiosaur alone took her ten years of patient excavation. \nAlthough untrained, Anning was also able to provide competent drawings and descriptions for \nscholars. But even with the advantage of her skills, significant finds were rare and she passed \nmost of her life in poverty. \n    It would be hard to think of a more overlooked person in the history of paleontology than \nMary Anning, but in fact there was one who came painfully close. His name was Gideon \nAlgernon Mantell and he was a country doctor in Sussex. \n    Mantell was a lanky assemblage of shortcomings\u2014he was vain, self-absorbed, priggish, \nneglectful of his family\u2014but never was there a more devoted amateur paleontologist. He was \nalso lucky to have a devoted and observant wife. In 1822, while he was making a house call \non a patient in rural Sussex, Mrs. Mantell went for a stroll down a nearby lane and in a pile of \nrubble that had been left to fill potholes she found a curious object\u2014a curved brown stone, \nabout the size of a small walnut. Knowing her husband\u2019s interest in fossils, and thinking it \nmight be one, she took it to him. Mantell could see at once it was a fossilized tooth, and after \na little study became certain that it was from an animal that was herbivorous, reptilian, \nextremely large\u2014tens of feet long\u2014and from the Cretaceous period. He was right on all \ncounts, but these were bold conclusions since nothing like it had been seen before or even \nimagined. \n    Aware that his finding would entirely upend what was understood about the past, and urged \nby his friend the Reverend William Buckland\u2014he of the gowns and experimental appetite\u2014\nto proceed with caution, Mantell devoted three painstaking years to seeking evidence to \nsupport his conclusions. He sent the tooth to Cuvier in Paris for an opinion, but the great \nFrenchman dismissed it as being from a hippopotamus. (Cuvier later apologized handsomely \nfor this uncharacteristic error.) One day while doing research at the Hunterian Museum in \nLondon, Mantell fell into conversation with a fellow researcher who told him the tooth looked \nvery like those of animals he had been studying, South American iguanas. A hasty \ncomparison confirmed the resemblance. And so Mantell\u2019s creature became Iguanodon , after \na basking tropical lizard to which it was not in any manner related. \n    Mantell prepared a paper for delivery to the Royal Society. Unfortunately it emerged that \nanother dinosaur had been found at a quarry in Oxfordshire and had just been formally \ndescribed\u2014by the Reverend Buckland, the very man who had urged him not to work in haste. \nIt was the Megalosaurus, and the name was actually suggested to Buckland by his friend Dr. \nJames Parkinson, the would-be radical and eponym for Parkinson\u2019s disease. Buckland, it may \nbe recalled, was foremost a geologist, and he showed it with his work on Megalosaurus. In his \nreport, for the Transactions of the Geological Society of London , he noted that the creature\u2019s \nteeth were not attached directly to the jawbone as in lizards but placed in sockets in the \nmanner of crocodiles. But having noticed this much, Buckland failed to realize what it meant: \nMegalosaurus was an entirely new type of creature. So although his report demonstrated little \nacuity or insight, it was still the first published description of a dinosaur, and so to him ratherthan the far more deserving Mantell goes the credit for the discovery of this ancient line of \nbeings. \n    Unaware that disappointment was going to be a continuing feature of his life, Mantell \ncontinued hunting for fossils\u2014he found another giant, the Hylaeosaurus, in 1833\u2014and \npurchasing others from quarrymen and farmers until he had probably the largest fossil \ncollection in Britain. Mantell was an excellent doctor and equally gifted bone hunter, but he \nwas unable to support both his talents. As his collecting mania grew, he neglected his medical \npractice. Soon fossils filled nearly the whole of his house in Brighton and consumed much of \nhis income. Much of the rest went to underwriting the publication of books that few cared to \nown. Illustrations of the Geology of Sussex , published in 1827, sold only fifty copies and left \nhim \u00a3300 out of pocket\u2014an uncomfortably substantial sum for the times. \n    In some desperation Mantell hit on the idea of turning his house into a museum and \ncharging admission, then belatedly realized that such a mercenary act would ruin his standing \nas a gentleman, not to mention as a scientist, and so he allowed people to visit the house for \nfree. They came in their hundreds, week after week, disrupting both his practice and his home \nlife. Eventually he was forced to sell most of his collection to pay off his debts. Soon after, his \nwife left him, taking their four children with her. \n    Remarkably, his troubles were only just beginning. \n  \n    In the district of Sydenham in south London, at a place called Crystal Palace Park, there \nstands a strange and forgotten sight: the world\u2019s first life-sized models of dinosaurs. Not many \npeople travel there these days, but once this was one of the most popular attractions in \nLondon\u2014in effect, as Richard Fortey has noted, the world\u2019s first theme park. Quite a lot \nabout the models is not strictly correct. The iguanodon\u2019s thumb has been placed on its nose, \nas a kind of spike, and it stands on four sturdy legs, making it look like a rather stout and \nawkwardly overgrown dog. (In life, the iguanodon did not crouch on all fours, but was \nbipedal.) Looking at them now you would scarcely guess that these odd and lumbering beasts \ncould cause great rancor and bitterness, but they did. Perhaps nothing in natural history has \nbeen at the center of fiercer and more enduring hatreds than the line of ancient beasts known \nas dinosaurs. \n    At the time of the dinosaurs\u2019 construction, Sydenham was on the edge of London and its \nspacious park was considered an ideal place to re-erect the famous Crystal Palace, the glass \nand cast-iron structure that had been the centerpiece of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and from \nwhich the new park naturally took its name. The dinosaurs, built of concrete, were a kind of \nbonus attraction. On New Year\u2019s Eve 1853 a famous dinner for twenty-one prominent \nscientists was held inside the unfinished iguanodon. Gideon Mantell, the man who had found \nand identified the iguanodon, was not among them. The person at the head of the table was \nthe greatest star of the young science of paleontology. His name was Richard Owen and by \nthis time he had already devoted several productive years to making Gideon Mantell\u2019s life \nhell. \n    Owen had grown up in Lancaster, in the north of England, where he had trained as a doctor. \nHe was a born anatomist and so devoted to his studies that he sometimes illicitly borrowed \nlimbs, organs, and other parts from cadavers and took them home for leisurely dissection. \nOnce while carrying a sack containing the head of a black African sailor that he had justremoved, Owen slipped on a wet cobble and watched in horror as the head bounced away \nfrom him down the lane and through the open doorway of a cottage, where it came to rest in \nthe front parlor. What the occupants had to say upon finding an unattached head rolling to a \nhalt at their feet can only be imagined. One assumes that they had not formed any terribly \nadvanced conclusions when, an instant later, a fraught-looking young man rushed in, \nwordlessly retrieved the head, and rushed out again. \n    In 1825, aged just twenty-one, Owen moved to London and soon after was engaged by the \nRoyal College of Surgeons to help organize their extensive, but disordered, collections of \nmedical and anatomical specimens. Most of these had been left to the institution by John \nHunter, a distinguished surgeon and tireless collector of medical curiosities, but had never \nbeen catalogued or organized, largely because the paperwork explaining the significance of \neach had gone missing soon after Hunter\u2019s death. \n    Owen swiftly distinguished himself with his powers of organization and deduction. At the \nsame time he showed himself to be a peerless anatomist with instincts for reconstruction \nalmost on a par with the great Cuvier in Paris. He become such an expert on the anatomy of \nanimals that he was granted first refusal on any animal that died at the London Zoological \nGardens, and these he would invariably have delivered to his house for examination. Once his \nwife returned home to find a freshly deceased rhinoceros filling the front hallway. He quickly \nbecame a leading expert on all kinds of animals living and extinct\u2014from platypuses, \nechidnas, and other newly discovered marsupials to the hapless dodo and the extinct giant \nbirds called moas that had roamed New Zealand until eaten out of existence by the Maoris. He \nwas the first to describe the archaeopteryx after its discovery in Bavaria in 1861 and the first \nto write a formal epitaph for the dodo. Altogether he produced some six hundred anatomical \npapers, a prodigious output. \n    But it was for his work with dinosaurs that Owen is remembered. He coined the term \ndinosauria in 1841. It means \u201cterrible lizard\u201d and was a curiously inapt name. Dinosaurs, as \nwe now know, weren\u2019t all terrible\u2014some were no bigger than rabbits and probably extremely \nretiring\u2014and the one thing they most emphatically were not was lizards, which are actually of \na much older (by thirty million years) lineage. Owen was well aware that the creatures were \nreptilian and had at his disposal a perfectly good Greek word, herpeton, but for some reason \nchose not to use it. Another, more excusable error (given the paucity of specimens at the time) \nwas that dinosaurs constitute not one but two orders of reptiles: the bird-hipped ornithischians \nand the lizard-hipped saurischians. \n    Owen was not an attractive person, in appearance or in temperament. A photograph from \nhis late middle years shows him as gaunt and sinister, like the villain in a Victorian \nmelodrama, with long, lank hair and bulging eyes\u2014a face to frighten babies. In manner he \nwas cold and imperious, and he was without scruple in the furtherance of his ambitions. He \nwas the only person Charles Darwin was ever known to hate. Even Owen\u2019s son (who soon \nafter killed himself) referred to his father\u2019s \u201clamentable coldness of heart.\u201d \n    His undoubted gifts as an anatomist allowed him to get away with the most barefaced \ndishonesties. In 1857, the naturalist T. H. Huxley was leafing through a new edition of \nChurchill\u2019s Medical Directory when he noticed that Owen was listed as Professor of \nComparative Anatomy and Physiology at the Government School of Mines, which rather \nsurprised Huxley as that was the position he held. Upon inquiring how Churchill\u2019s had made \nsuch an elemental error, he was told that the information had been provided to them by Dr. \nOwen himself. A fellow naturalist named Hugh Falconer, meanwhile, caught Owen takingcredit for one of his discoveries. Others accused him of borrowing specimens, then denying \nhe had done so. Owen even fell into a bitter dispute with the Queen\u2019s dentist over the credit \nfor a theory concerning the physiology of teeth. \n    He did not hesitate to persecute those whom he disliked. Early in his career Owen used his \ninfluence at the Zoological Society to blackball a young man named Robert Grant whose only \ncrime was to have shown promise as a fellow anatomist. Grant was astonished to discover that \nhe was suddenly denied access to the anatomical specimens he needed to conduct his \nresearch. Unable to pursue his work, he sank into an understandably dispirited obscurity. \n    But no one suffered more from Owen\u2019s unkindly attentions than the hapless and \nincreasingly tragic Gideon Mantell. After losing his wife, his children, his medical practice, \nand most of his fossil collection, Mantell moved to London. There in 1841\u2014the fateful year \nin which Owen would achieve his greatest glory for naming and identifying the dinosaurs\u2014\nMantell was involved in a terrible accident. While crossing Clapham Common in a carriage, \nhe somehow fell from his seat, grew entangled in the reins, and was dragged at a gallop over \nrough ground by the panicked horses. The accident left him bent, crippled, and in chronic \npain, with a spine damaged beyond repair. \n    Capitalizing on Mantell\u2019s enfeebled state, Owen set about systematically expunging \nMantell\u2019s contributions from the record, renaming species that Mantell had named years \nbefore and claiming credit for their discovery for himself. Mantell continued to try to do \noriginal research but Owen used his influence at the Royal Society to ensure that most of his \npapers were rejected. In 1852, unable to bear any more pain or persecution, Mantell took his \nown life. His deformed spine was removed and sent to the Royal College of Surgeons \nwhere\u2014and now here\u2019s an irony for you\u2014it was placed in the care of Richard Owen, director \nof the college\u2019s Hunterian Museum. \n    But the insults had not quite finished. Soon after Mantell\u2019s death an arrestingly uncharitable \nobituary appeared in the Literary Gazette. In it Mantell was characterized as a mediocre \nanatomist whose modest contributions to paleontology were limited by a \u201cwant of exact \nknowledge.\u201d The obituary even removed the discovery of the iguanodon from him and \ncredited it instead to Cuvier and Owen, among others. Though the piece carried no byline, the \nstyle was Owen\u2019s and no one in the world of the natural sciences doubted the authorship. \n    By this stage, however, Owen\u2019s transgressions were beginning to catch up with him. His \nundoing began when a committee of the Royal Society\u2014a committee of which he happened \nto be chairman\u2014decided to award him its highest honor, the Royal Medal, for a paper he had \nwritten on an extinct mollusc called the belemnite. \u201cHowever,\u201d as Deborah Cadbury notes in \nher excellent history of the period, Terrible Lizard, \u201cthis piece of work was not quite as \noriginal as it appeared.\u201d The belemnite, it turned out, had been discovered four years earlier \nby an amateur naturalist named Chaning Pearce, and the discovery had been fully reported at \na meeting of the Geological Society. Owen had been at that meeting, but failed to mention \nthis when he presented a report of his own to the Royal Society\u2014in which, not incidentally, \nhe rechristened the creature Belemnites owenii in his own honor. Although Owen was allowed \nto keep the Royal Medal, the episode left a permanent tarnish on his reputation, even among \nhis few remaining supporters. \n    Eventually Huxley managed to do to Owen what Owen had done to so many others: he had \nhim voted off the councils of the Zoological and Royal societies. As a final insult Huxley \nbecame the new Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons.Owen would never again do important research, but the latter half of his career was devoted \nto one unexceptionable pursuit for which we can all be grateful. In 1856 he became head of \nthe natural history section of the British Museum, in which capacity he became the driving \nforce behind the creation of London\u2019s Natural History Museum. The grand and beloved \nGothic heap in South Kensington, opened in 1880, is almost entirely a testament to his vision. \n    Before Owen, museums were designed primarily for the use and edification of the elite, and \neven then it was difficult to gain access. In the early days of the British Museum, prospective \nvisitors had to make a written application and undergo a brief interview to determine if they \nwere fit to be admitted at all. They then had to return a second time to pick up a ticket\u2014that is \nassuming they had passed the interview\u2014and finally come back a third time to view the \nmuseum\u2019s treasures. Even then they were whisked through in groups and not allowed to \nlinger. Owen\u2019s plan was to welcome everyone, even to the point of encouraging workingmen \nto visit in the evening, and to devote most of the museum\u2019s space to public displays. He even \nproposed, very radically, to put informative labels on each display so that people could \nappreciate what they were viewing. In this, somewhat unexpectedly, he was opposed by T. H. \nHuxley, who believed that museums should be primarily research institutes. By making the \nNatural History Museum an institution for everyone, Owen transformed our expectations of \nwhat museums are for. \n    Still, his altruism in general toward his fellow man did not deflect him from more personal \nrivalries. One of his last official acts was to lobby against a proposal to erect a statue in \nmemory of Charles Darwin. In this he failed\u2014though he did achieve a certain belated, \ninadvertent triumph. Today his statue commands a masterly view from the staircase of the \nmain hall in the Natural History Museum, while Darwin and T. H. Huxley are consigned \nsomewhat obscurely to the museum coffee shop, where they stare gravely over people \nsnacking on cups of tea and jam doughnuts. \n  \n    It would be reasonable to suppose that Richard Owen\u2019s petty rivalries marked the low point \nof nineteenth-century paleontology, but in fact worse was to come, this time from overseas. In \nAmerica in the closing decades of the century there arose a rivalry even more spectacularly \nvenomous, if not quite as destructive. It was between two strange and ruthless men, Edward \nDrinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh. \n    They had much in common. Both were spoiled, driven, self-centered, quarrelsome, jealous, \nmistrustful, and ever unhappy. Between them they changed the world of paleontology. \n    They began as mutual friends and admirers, even naming fossil species after each other, \nand spent a pleasant week together in 1868. However, something then went wrong between \nthem\u2014nobody is quite sure what\u2014and by the following year they had developed an enmity \nthat would grow into consuming hatred over the next thirty years. It is probably safe to say \nthat no two people in the natural sciences have ever despised each other more. \n    Marsh, the elder of the two by eight years, was a retiring and bookish fellow, with a trim \nbeard and dapper manner, who spent little time in the field and was seldom very good at \nfinding things when he was there. On a visit to the famous dinosaur fields of Como Bluff, \nWyoming, he failed to notice the bones that were, in the words of one historian, \u201clying \neverywhere like logs.\u201d But he had the means to buy almost anything he wanted. Although he \ncame from a modest background\u2014his father was a farmer in upstate New York\u2014his unclewas the supremely rich and extraordinarily indulgent financier George Peabody. When Marsh \nshowed an interest in natural history, Peabody had a museum built for him at Yale and \nprovided funds sufficient for Marsh to fill it with almost whatever took his fancy. \n    Cope was born more directly into privilege\u2014his father was a rich Philadelphia \nbusinessman\u2014and was by far the more adventurous of the two. In the summer of 1876 in \nMontana while George Armstrong Custer and his troops were being cut down at Little Big \nHorn, Cope was out hunting for bones nearby. When it was pointed out to him that this was \nprobably not the most prudent time to be taking treasures from Indian lands, Cope thought for \na minute and decided to press on anyway. He was having too good a season. At one point he \nran into a party of suspicious Crow Indians, but he managed to win them over by repeatedly \ntaking out and replacing his false teeth. \n    For a decade or so, Marsh and Cope\u2019s mutual dislike primarily took the form of quiet \nsniping, but in 1877 it erupted into grandiose dimensions. In that year a Colorado \nschoolteacher named Arthur Lakes found bones near Morrison while out hiking with a friend. \nRecognizing the bones as coming from a \u201cgigantic saurian,\u201d Lakes thoughtfully dispatched \nsome samples to both Marsh and Cope. A delighted Cope sent Lakes a hundred dollars for his \ntrouble and asked him not to tell anyone of his discovery, especially Marsh. Confused, Lakes \nnow asked Marsh to pass the bones on to Cope. Marsh did so, but it was an affront that he \nwould never forget. \n    It also marked the start of a war between the two that became increasingly bitter, \nunderhand, and often ridiculous. They sometimes stooped to one team\u2019s diggers throwing \nrocks at the other team\u2019s. Cope was caught at one point jimmying open crates that belonged to \nMarsh. They insulted each other in print and each poured scorn on the other\u2019s results. \nSeldom\u2014perhaps never\u2014has science been driven forward more swiftly and successfully by \nanimosity. Over the next several years the two men between them increased the number of \nknown dinosaur species in America from 9 to almost 150. Nearly every dinosaur that the \naverage person can name\u2014stegosaurus, brontosaurus, diplodocus, triceratops\u2014was found by \none or the other of them.1 Unfortunately, they worked in such reckless haste that they often \nfailed to note that a new discovery was something already known. Between them they \nmanaged to \u201cdiscover\u201d a species calledUintatheres anceps no fewer than twenty-two times. It \ntook years to sort out some of the classification messes they made. Some are not sorted out \nyet. \n    Of the two, Cope\u2019s scientific legacy was much the more substantial. In a breathtakingly \nindustrious career, he wrote some 1,400 learned papers and described almost 1,300 new \nspecies of fossil (of all types, not just dinosaurs)\u2014more than double Marsh\u2019s output in both \ncases. Cope might have done even more, but unfortunately he went into a rather precipitate \ndescent in his later years. Having inherited a fortune in 1875, he invested unwisely in silver \nand lost everything. He ended up living in a single room in a Philadelphia boarding house, \nsurrounded by books, papers, and bones. Marsh by contrast finished his days in a splendid \nmansion in New Haven. Cope died in 1897, Marsh two years later. \n    In his final years, Cope developed one other interesting obsession. It became his earnest \nwish to be declared the type specimen forHomo sapiens \u2014that is, that his bones would be the \nofficial set for the human race. Normally, the type specimen of a species is the first set of \n                                                 \n1 The notable exception being the Tyrannosaurus rex, which was found by Barnum Brown in 1902.bones found, but since no first set of Homo sapiens bones exists, there was a vacancy, which \nCope desired to fill. It was an odd and vain wish, but no one could think of any grounds to \noppose it. To that end, Cope willed his bones to the Wistar Institute, a learned society in \nPhiladelphia endowed by the descendants of the seemingly inescapable Caspar Wistar. \nUnfortunately, after his bones were prepared and assembled, it was found that they showed \nsigns of incipient syphilis, hardly a feature one would wish to preserve in the type specimen \nfor one\u2019s own race. So Cope\u2019s petition and his bones were quietly shelved. There is still no \ntype specimen for modern humans. \n    As for the other players in this drama, Owen died in 1892, a few years before Cope or \nMarsh. Buckland ended up by losing his mind and finished his days a gibbering wreck in a \nlunatic asylum in Clapham, not far from where Mantell had suffered his crippling accident. \nMantell\u2019s twisted spine remained on display at the Hunterian Museum for nearly a century \nbefore being mercifully obliterated by a German bomb in the Blitz. What remained of \nMantell\u2019s collection after his death passed on to his children, and much of it was taken to New \nZealand by his son Walter, who emigrated there in 1840. Walter became a distinguished Kiwi, \neventually attaining the office of Minister of Native Affairs. In 1865 he donated the prime \nspecimens from his father\u2019s collection, including the famous iguanodon tooth, to the Colonial \nMuseum (now the Museum of New Zealand) in Wellington, where they have remained ever \nsince. The iguanodon tooth that started it all\u2014arguably the most important tooth in \npaleontology\u2014is no longer on display. \n  \n    Of course dinosaur hunting didn\u2019t end with the deaths of the great nineteenth-century fossil \nhunters. Indeed, to a surprising extent it had only just begun. In 1898, the year that fell \nbetween the deaths of Cope and Marsh, a trove greater by far than anything found before was \ndiscovered\u2014noticed, really\u2014at a place called Bone Cabin Quarry, only a few miles from \nMarsh\u2019s prime hunting ground at Como Bluff, Wyoming. There, hundreds and hundreds of \nfossil bones were to be found weathering out of the hills. They were so numerous, in fact, that \nsomeone had built a cabin out of them\u2014hence the name. In just the first two seasons, 100,000 \npounds of ancient bones were excavated from the site, and tens of thousands of pounds more \ncame in each of the half dozen years that followed. \n    The upshot is that by the turn of the twentieth century, paleontologists had literally tons of \nold bones to pick over. The problem was that they still didn\u2019t have any idea how old any of \nthese bones were. Worse, the agreed ages for the Earth couldn\u2019t comfortably support the \nnumbers of eons and ages and epochs that the past obviously contained. If Earth were really \nonly twenty million years old or so, as the great Lord Kelvin insisted, then whole orders of \nancient creatures must have come into being and gone out again practically in the same \ngeological instant. It just made no sense. \n    Other scientists besides Kelvin turned their minds to the problem and came up with results \nthat only deepened the uncertainty. Samuel Haughton, a respected geologist at Trinity College \nin Dublin, announced an estimated age for the Earth of 2,300 million years\u2014way beyond \nanything anybody else was suggesting. When this was drawn to his attention, he recalculated \nusing the same data and put the figure at 153 million years. John Joly, also of Trinity, decided \nto give Edmond Halley\u2019s ocean salts idea a whirl, but his method was based on so many \nfaulty assumptions that he was hopelessly adrift. He calculated that the Earth was 89 million \nyears old\u2014an age that fit neatly enough with Kelvin\u2019s assumptions but unfortunately not with \nreality.Such was the confusion that by the close of the nineteenth century, depending on which \ntext you consulted, you could learn that the number of years that stood between us and the \ndawn of complex life in the Cambrian period was 3 million, 18 million, 600 million, 794 \nmillion, or 2.4 billion\u2014or some other number within that range. As late as 1910, one of the \nmost respected estimates, by the American George Becker, put the Earth\u2019s age at perhaps as \nlittle as 55 million years. \n    Just when matters seemed most intractably confused, along came another extraordinary \nfigure with a novel approach. He was a bluff and brilliant New Zealand farm boy named \nErnest Rutherford, and he produced pretty well irrefutable evidence that the Earth was at least \nmany hundreds of millions of years old, probably rather more. \n    Remarkably, his evidence was based on alchemy\u2014natural, spontaneous, scientifically \ncredible, and wholly non-occult, but alchemy nonetheless. Newton, it turned out, had not been \nso wrong after all. And exactly how that came to be is of course another story.", "7": "7    ELEMENTAL MATTERS \nCHEMISTRY AS AN earnest and respectable science is often said to date from 1661, when \nRobert Boyle of Oxford published The Sceptical Chymist \u2014the first work to distinguish \nbetween chemists and alchemists\u2014but it was a slow and often erratic transition. Into the \neighteenth century scholars could feel oddly comfortable in both camps\u2014like the German \nJohann Becher, who produced an unexceptionable work on mineralogy called Physica \nSubterranea , but who also was certain that, given the right materials, he could make himself \ninvisible. \n    Perhaps nothing better typifies the strange and often accidental nature of chemical science \nin its early days than a discovery made by a German named Hennig Brand in 1675. Brand \nbecame convinced that gold could somehow be distilled from human urine. (The similarity of \ncolor seems to have been a factor in his conclusion.) He assembled fifty buckets of human \nurine, which he kept for months in his cellar. By various recondite processes, he converted the \nurine first into a noxious paste and then into a translucent waxy substance. None of it yielded \ngold, of course, but a strange and interesting thing did happen. After a time, the substance \nbegan to glow. Moreover, when exposed to air, it often spontaneously burst into flame. \n    The commercial potential for the stuff\u2014which soon became known as phosphorus, from \nGreek and Latin roots meaning \u201clight bearing\u201d\u2014was not lost on eager businesspeople, but the \ndifficulties of manufacture made it too costly to exploit. An ounce of phosphorus retailed for \nsix guineas\u2014perhaps five hundred dollars in today\u2019s money\u2014or more than gold. \n    At first, soldiers were called on to provide the raw material, but such an arrangement was \nhardly conducive to industrial-scale production. In the 1750s a Swedish chemist named Karl \n(or Carl) Scheele devised a way to manufacture phosphorus in bulk without the slop or smell \nof urine. It was largely because of this mastery of phosphorus that Sweden became, and \nremains, a leading producer of matches. \n    Scheele was both an extraordinary and extraordinarily luckless fellow. A poor pharmacist \nwith little in the way of advanced apparatus, he discovered eight elements\u2014chlorine, fluorine, \nmanganese, barium, molybdenum, tungsten, nitrogen, and oxygen\u2014and got credit for none of \nthem. In every case, his finds were either overlooked or made it into publication after \nsomeone else had made the same discovery independently. He also discovered many useful \ncompounds, among them ammonia, glycerin, and tannic acid, and was the first to see the \ncommercial potential of chlorine as a bleach\u2014all breakthroughs that made other people \nextremely wealthy. \n    Scheele\u2019s one notable shortcoming was a curious insistence on tasting a little of everything \nhe worked with, including such notoriously disagreeable substances as mercury, prussic acid \n(another of his discoveries), and hydrocyanic acid\u2014a compound so famously poisonous that \n150 years later Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger chose it as his toxin of choice in a famous thought \nexperiment (see page 146). Scheele\u2019s rashness eventually caught up with him. In 1786, aged \njust forty-three, he was found dead at his workbench surrounded by an array of toxic \nchemicals, any one of which could have accounted for the stunned and terminal look on his \nface. \n    Were the world just and Swedish-speaking, Scheele would have enjoyed universal acclaim. \nInstead credit has tended to lodge with more celebrated chemists, mostly from the English-\nspeaking world. Scheele discovered oxygen in 1772, but for various heartbreakinglycomplicated reasons could not get his paper published in a timely manner. Instead credit went \nto Joseph Priestley, who discovered the same element independently, but latterly, in the \nsummer of 1774. Even more remarkable was Scheele\u2019s failure to receive credit for the \ndiscovery of chlorine. Nearly all textbooks still attribute chlorine\u2019s discovery to Humphry \nDavy, who did indeed find it, but thirty-six years after Scheele had. \n    Although chemistry had come a long way in the century that separated Newton and Boyle \nfrom Scheele and Priestley and Henry Cavendish, it still had a long way to go. Right up to the \nclosing years of the eighteenth century (and in Priestley\u2019s case a little beyond) scientists \neverywhere searched for, and sometimes believed they had actually found, things that just \nweren\u2019t there: vitiated airs, dephlogisticated marine acids, phloxes, calxes, terraqueous \nexhalations, and, above all, phlogiston, the substance that was thought to be the active agent \nin combustion. Somewhere in all this, it was thought, there also resided a mysterious \u00e9lan \nvital, the force that brought inanimate objects to life. No one knew where this ethereal essence \nlay, but two things seemed probable: that you could enliven it with a jolt of electricity (a \nnotion Mary Shelley exploited to full effect in her novel Frankenstein ) and that it existed in \nsome substances but not others, which is why we ended up with two branches of chemistry: \norganic (for those substances that were thought to have it) and inorganic (for those that did \nnot). \n    Someone of insight was needed to thrust chemistry into the modern age, and it was the \nFrench who provided him. His name was Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier. Born in 1743, Lavoisier \nwas a member of the minor nobility (his father had purchased a title for the family). In 1768, \nhe bought a practicing share in a deeply despised institution called the Ferme G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (or \nGeneral Farm), which collected taxes and fees on behalf of the government. Although \nLavoisier himself was by all accounts mild and fair-minded, the company he worked for was \nneither. For one thing, it did not tax the rich but only the poor, and then often arbitrarily. For \nLavoisier, the appeal of the institution was that it provided him with the wealth to follow his \nprincipal devotion, science. At his peak, his personal earnings reached 150,000 livres a year\u2014\nperhaps $20 million in today\u2019s money. \n    Three years after embarking on this lucrative career path, he married the fourteen-year-old \ndaughter of one of his bosses. The marriage was a meeting of hearts and minds both. Madame \nLavoisier had an incisive intellect and soon was working productively alongside her husband. \nDespite the demands of his job and busy social life, they managed to put in five hours of \nscience on most days\u2014two in the early morning and three in the evening\u2014as well as the \nwhole of Sunday, which they called their jour de bonheur (day of happiness). Somehow \nLavoisier also found the time to be commissioner of gunpowder, supervise the building of a \nwall around Paris to deter smugglers, help found the metric system, and coauthor the \nhandbook M\u00e9thode de Nomenclature Chimique , which became the bible for agreeing on the \nnames of the elements. \n    As a leading member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, he was also required to take an \ninformed and active interest in whatever was topical\u2014hypnotism, prison reform, the \nrespiration of insects, the water supply of Paris. It was in such a capacity in 1780 that \nLavoisier made some dismissive remarks about a new theory of combustion that had been \nsubmitted to the academy by a hopeful young scientist. The theory was indeed wrong, but the \nscientist never forgave him. His name was Jean-Paul Marat. \n    The one thing Lavoisier never did was discover an element. At a time when it seemed as if \nalmost anybody with a beaker, a flame, and some interesting powders could discoversomething new\u2014and when, not incidentally, some two-thirds of the elements were yet to be \nfound\u2014Lavoisier failed to uncover a single one. It certainly wasn\u2019t for want of beakers. \nLavoisier had thirteen thousand of them in what was, to an almost preposterous degree, the \nfinest private laboratory in existence. \n    Instead he took the discoveries of others and made sense of them. He threw out phlogiston \nand mephitic airs. He identified oxygen and hydrogen for what they were and gave them both \ntheir modern names. In short, he helped to bring rigor, clarity, and method to chemistry. \n    And his fancy equipment did in fact come in very handy. For years, he and Madame \nLavoisier occupied themselves with extremely exacting studies requiring the finest \nmeasurements. They determined, for instance, that a rusting object doesn\u2019t lose weight, as \neveryone had long assumed, but gains weight\u2014an extraordinary discovery. Somehow as it \nrusted the object was attracting elemental particles from the air. It was the first realization that \nmatter can be transformed but not eliminated. If you burned this book now, its matter would \nbe changed to ash and smoke, but the net amount of stuff in the universe would be the same. \nThis became known as the conservation of mass, and it was a revolutionary concept. \nUnfortunately, it coincided with another type of revolution\u2014the French one\u2014and for this one \nLavoisier was entirely on the wrong side. \n    Not only was he a member of the hated Ferme G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, but he had enthusiastically built \nthe wall that enclosed Paris\u2014an edifice so loathed that it was the first thing attacked by the \nrebellious citizens. Capitalizing on this, in 1791 Marat, now a leading voice in the National \nAssembly, denounced Lavoisier and suggested that it was well past time for his hanging. \nSoon afterward the Ferme G\u00e9n\u00e9rale was shut down. Not long after this Marat was murdered \nin his bath by an aggrieved young woman named Charlotte Corday, but by this time it was too \nlate for Lavoisier. \n    In 1793, the Reign of Terror, already intense, ratcheted up to a higher gear. In October \nMarie Antoinette was sent to the guillotine. The following month, as Lavoisier and his wife \nwere making tardy plans to slip away to Scotland, Lavoisier was arrested. In May he and \nthirty-one fellow farmers-general were brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal (in a \ncourtroom presided over by a bust of Marat). Eight were granted acquittals, but Lavoisier and \nthe others were taken directly to the Place de la Revolution (now the Place de la Concorde), \nsite of the busiest of French guillotines. Lavoisier watched his father-in-law beheaded, then \nstepped up and accepted his fate. Less than three months later, on July 27, Robespierre \nhimself was dispatched in the same way and in the same place, and the Reign of Terror \nswiftly ended. \n    A hundred years after his death, a statue of Lavoisier was erected in Paris and much \nadmired until someone pointed out that it looked nothing like him. Under questioning the \nsculptor admitted that he had used the head of the mathematician and philosopher the Marquis \nde Condorcet\u2014apparently he had a spare\u2014in the hope that no one would notice or, having \nnoticed, would care. In the second regard he was correct. The statue of Lavoisier-cum-\nCondorcet was allowed to remain in place for another half century until the Second World \nWar when, one morning, it was taken away and melted down for scrap. \n  \n    In the early 1800s there arose in England a fashion for inhaling nitrous oxide, or laughing \ngas, after it was discovered that its use \u201cwas attended by a highly pleasurable thrilling.\u201d Forthe next half century it would be the drug of choice for young people. One learned body, the \nAskesian Society, was for a time devoted to little else. Theaters put on \u201claughing gas \nevenings\u201d where volunteers could refresh themselves with a robust inhalation and then \nentertain the audience with their comical staggerings. \n    It wasn\u2019t until 1846 that anyone got around to finding a practical use for nitrous oxide, as \nan anesthetic. Goodness knows how many tens of thousands of people suffered unnecessary \nagonies under the surgeon\u2019s knife because no one thought of the gas\u2019s most obvious practical \napplication. \n    I mention this to make the point that chemistry, having come so far in the eighteenth \ncentury, rather lost its bearings in the first decades of the nineteenth, in much the way that \ngeology would in the early years of the twentieth. Partly it was to do with the limitations of \nequipment\u2014there were, for instance, no centrifuges until the second half of the century, \nseverely restricting many kinds of experiments\u2014and partly it was social. Chemistry was, \ngenerally speaking, a science for businesspeople, for those who worked with coal and potash \nand dyes, and not gentlemen, who tended to be drawn to geology, natural history, and physics. \n(This was slightly less true in continental Europe than in Britain, but only slightly.) It is \nperhaps telling that one of the most important observations of the century, Brownian motion, \nwhich established the active nature of molecules, was made not by a chemist but by a Scottish \nbotanist, Robert Brown. (What Brown noticed, in 1827, was that tiny grains of pollen \nsuspended in water remained indefinitely in motion no matter how long he gave them to \nsettle. The cause of this perpetual motion\u2014namely the actions of invisible molecules\u2014was \nlong a mystery.) \n    Things might have been worse had it not been for a splendidly improbable character named \nCount von Rumford, who, despite the grandeur of his title, began life in Woburn, \nMassachusetts, in 1753 as plain Benjamin Thompson. Thompson was dashing and ambitious, \n\u201chandsome in feature and figure,\u201d occasionally courageous and exceedingly bright, but \nuntroubled by anything so inconveniencing as a scruple. At nineteen he married a rich widow \nfourteen years his senior, but at the outbreak of revolution in the colonies he unwisely sided \nwith the loyalists, for a time spying on their behalf. In the fateful year of 1776, facing arrest \n\u201cfor lukewarmness in the cause of liberty,\u201d he abandoned his wife and child and fled just \nahead of a mob of anti-Royalists armed with buckets of hot tar, bags of feathers, and an \nearnest desire to adorn him with both. \n    He decamped first to England and then to Germany, where he served as a military advisor \nto the government of Bavaria, so impressing the authorities that in 1791 he was named Count \nvon Rumford of the Holy Roman Empire. While in Munich, he also designed and laid out the \nfamous park known as the English Garden. \n    In between these undertakings, he somehow found time to conduct a good deal of solid \nscience. He became the world\u2019s foremost authority on thermodynamics and the first to \nelucidate the principles of the convection of fluids and the circulation of ocean currents. He \nalso invented several useful objects, including a drip coffeemaker, thermal underwear, and a \ntype of range still known as the Rumford fireplace. In 1805, during a sojourn in France, he \nwooed and married Madame Lavoisier, widow of Antoine-Laurent. The marriage was not a \nsuccess and they soon parted. Rumford stayed on in France, where he died, universally \nesteemed by all but his former wives, in 1814.But our purpose in mentioning him here is that in 1799, during a comparatively brief \ninterlude in London, he founded the Royal Institution, yet another of the many learned \nsocieties that popped into being all over Britain in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth \ncenturies. For a time it was almost the only institution of standing to actively promote the \nyoung science of chemistry, and that was thanks almost entirely to a brilliant young man \nnamed Humphry Davy, who was appointed the institution\u2019s professor of chemistry shortly \nafter its inception and rapidly gained fame as an outstanding lecturer and productive \nexperimentalist. \n    Soon after taking up his position, Davy began to bang out new elements one after \nanother\u2014potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and aluminum or aluminium, \ndepending on which branch of English you favor.1 He discovered so many elements not so \nmuch because he was serially astute as because he developed an ingenious technique of \napplying electricity to a molten substance\u2014electrolysis, as it is known. Altogether he \ndiscovered a dozen elements, a fifth of the known total of his day. Davy might have done far \nmore, but unfortunately as a young man he developed an abiding attachment to the buoyant \npleasures of nitrous oxide. He grew so attached to the gas that he drew on it (literally) three or \nfour times a day. Eventually, in 1829, it is thought to have killed him. \n    Fortunately more sober types were at work elsewhere. In 1808, a dour Quaker named John \nDalton became the first person to intimate the nature of an atom (progress that will be \ndiscussed more completely a little further on), and in 1811 an Italian with the splendidly \noperatic name of Lorenzo Romano Amadeo Carlo Avogadro, Count of Quarequa and Cerreto, \nmade a discovery that would prove highly significant in the long term\u2014namely, that two \nequal volumes of gases of any type, if kept at the same pressure and temperature, will contain \nidentical numbers of molecules. \n    Two things were notable about Avogadro\u2019s Principle, as it became known. First, it \nprovided a basis for more accurately measuring the size and weight of atoms. Using \nAvogadro\u2019s mathematics, chemists were eventually able to work out, for instance, that a \ntypical atom had a diameter of 0.00000008 centimeters, which is very little indeed. And \nsecond, almost no one knew about Avogadro\u2019s appealingly simple principle for almost fifty \nyears.2  \n    Partly this was because Avogadro himself was a retiring fellow\u2014he worked alone, \ncorresponded very little with fellow scientists, published few papers, and attended no \nmeetings\u2014but also it was because there were no meetings to attend and few chemical \njournals in which to publish. This is a fairly extraordinary fact. The Industrial Revolution was \n                                                 \n1 The confusion over the aluminum/aluminium spelling arose b cause of some uncharacteristic indecisiveness on \nDavy's part. When he first isolated the element in 1808, he called it alumium. For son reason he thought better of \nthat and changed it to aluminum four years later. Americans dutifully adopted the new term, but mai British \nusers disliked aluminum, pointing out that it disrupted the -ium pattern established by sodium, calcium, and \nstrontium, so they added a vowel and syllable. \n2 The principle led to the much later adoption of Avogadro's number, a basic unit of measure in chemistry, which \nwas named for Avogadro long after his death. It is the number of molecules found in 2.016 grams of hydrogen \ngas (or an equal volume of any other gas). Its value is placed at 6.0221367 x 1023, which is an enormously large \nnumber. Chemistry students have long amused themselves by computing just how large a number it is, so I can \nreport that it is equivalent to the number of popcorn kernels needed to cover the United States to a depth of nine \nmiles, or cupfuls of water in the Pacific Ocean, or soft drink cans that would, evenly stacked, cover the Earth to a \ndepth of 200 miles. An equivalent number of American pennies would be enough to make every person on Earth \na dollar trillionaire. It is a big number.driven in large part by developments in chemistry, and yet as an organized science chemistry \nbarely existed for decades. \n    The Chemical Society of London was not founded until 1841 and didn\u2019t begin to produce a \nregular journal until 1848, by which time most learned societies in Britain\u2014Geological, \nGeographical, Zoological, Horticultural, and Linnaean (for naturalists and botanists)\u2014were at \nleast twenty years old and often much more. The rival Institute of Chemistry didn\u2019t come into \nbeing until 1877, a year after the founding of the American Chemical Society. Because \nchemistry was so slow to get organized, news of Avogadro\u2019s important breakthrough of 1811 \ndidn\u2019t begin to become general until the first international chemistry congress, in Karlsruhe, \nin 1860. \n    Because chemists for so long worked in isolation, conventions were slow to emerge. Until \nwell into the second half of the century, the formula H2O2might mean water to one chemist \nbut hydrogen peroxide to another. C2H4could signify ethylene or marsh gas. There was hardly \na molecule that was uniformly represented everywhere. \n    Chemists also used a bewildering variety of symbols and abbreviations, often self-invented. \nSweden\u2019s J. J. Berzelius brought a much-needed measure of order to matters by decreeing that \nthe elements be abbreviated on the basis of their Greek or Latin names, which is why the \nabbreviation for iron is Fe (from the Latin ferrum ) and that for silver is Ag (from the Latin \nargentum ). That so many of the other abbreviations accord with their English names (N for \nnitrogen, O for Oxygen, H for hydrogen, and so on) reflects English\u2019s Latinate nature, not its \nexalted status. To indicate the number of atoms in a molecule, Berzelius employed a \nsuperscript notation, as in H2O. Later, for no special reason, the fashion became to render the \nnumber as subscript: H2O. \n    Despite the occasional tidyings-up, chemistry by the second half of the nineteenth century \nwas in something of a mess, which is why everybody was so pleased by the rise to \nprominence in 1869 of an odd and crazed-looking professor at the University of St. Petersburg \nnamed Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleyev. \n    Mendeleyev (also sometimes spelled Mendeleev or Mendel\u00e9ef) was born in 1834 at \nTobolsk, in the far west of Siberia, into a well-educated, reasonably prosperous, and very \nlarge family\u2014so large, in fact, that history has lost track of exactly how many Mendeleyevs \nthere were: some sources say there were fourteen children, some say seventeen. All agree, at \nany rate, that Dmitri was the youngest. Luck was not always with the Mendeleyevs. When \nDmitri was small his father, the headmaster of a local school, went blind and his mother had \nto go out to work. Clearly an extraordinary woman, she eventually became the manager of a \nsuccessful glass factory. All went well until 1848, when the factory burned down and the \nfamily was reduced to penury. Determined to get her youngest child an education, the \nindomitable Mrs. Mendeleyev hitchhiked with young Dmitri four thousand miles to St. \nPetersburg\u2014that\u2019s equivalent to traveling from London to Equatorial Guinea\u2014and deposited \nhim at the Institute of Pedagogy. Worn out by her efforts, she died soon after. \n    Mendeleyev dutifully completed his studies and eventually landed a position at the local \nuniversity. There he was a competent but not terribly outstanding chemist, known more for \nhis wild hair and beard, which he had trimmed just once a year, than for his gifts in the \nlaboratory.However, in 1869, at the age of thirty-five, he began to toy with a way to arrange the \nelements. At the time, elements were normally grouped in two ways\u2014either by atomic weight \n(using Avogadro\u2019s Principle) or by common properties (whether they were metals or gases, \nfor instance). Mendeleyev\u2019s breakthrough was to see that the two could be combined in a \nsingle table. \n    As is often the way in science, the principle had actually been anticipated three years \npreviously by an amateur chemist in England named John Newlands. He suggested that when \nelements were arranged by weight they appeared to repeat certain properties\u2014in a sense to \nharmonize\u2014at every eighth place along the scale. Slightly unwisely, for this was an idea \nwhose time had not quite yet come, Newlands called it the Law of Octaves and likened the \narrangement to the octaves on a piano keyboard. Perhaps there was something in Newlands\u2019s \nmanner of presentation, but the idea was considered fundamentally preposterous and widely \nmocked. At gatherings, droller members of the audience would sometimes ask him if he could \nget his elements to play them a little tune. Discouraged, Newlands gave up pushing the idea \nand soon dropped from view altogether. \n    Mendeleyev used a slightly different approach, placing his elements into groups of seven, \nbut employed fundamentally the same principle. Suddenly the idea seemed brilliant and \nwondrously perceptive. Because the properties repeated themselves periodically, the invention \nbecame known as the periodic table. \n    Mendeleyev was said to have been inspired by the card game known as solitaire in North \nAmerica and patience elsewhere, wherein cards are arranged by suit horizontally and by \nnumber vertically. Using a broadly similar concept, he arranged the elements in horizontal \nrows called periods and vertical columns called groups. This instantly showed one set of \nrelationships when read up and down and another when read from side to side. Specifically, \nthe vertical columns put together chemicals that have similar properties. Thus copper sits on \ntop of silver and silver sits on top of gold because of their chemical affinities as metals, while \nhelium, neon, and argon are in a column made up of gases. (The actual, formal determinant in \nthe ordering is something called their electron valences, for which you will have to enroll in \nnight classes if you wish an understanding.) The horizontal rows, meanwhile, arrange the \nchemicals in ascending order by the number of protons in their nuclei\u2014what is known as their \natomic number. \n    The structure of atoms and the significance of protons will come in a following chapter, so \nfor the moment all that is necessary is to appreciate the organizing principle: hydrogen has \njust one proton, and so it has an atomic number of one and comes first on the chart; uranium \nhas ninety-two protons, and so it comes near the end and has an atomic number of ninety-two. \nIn this sense, as Philip Ball has pointed out, chemistry really is just a matter of counting. \n(Atomic number, incidentally, is not to be confused with atomic weight, which is the number \nof protons plus the number of neutrons in a given element.) There was still a great deal that \nwasn\u2019t known or understood. Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe, and yet \nno one would guess as much for another thirty years. Helium, the second most abundant \nelement, had only been found the year before\u2014its existence hadn\u2019t even been suspected \nbefore that\u2014and then not on Earth but in the Sun, where it was found with a spectroscope \nduring a solar eclipse, which is why it honors the Greek sun god Helios. It wouldn\u2019t be \nisolated until 1895. Even so, thanks to Mendeleyev\u2019s invention, chemistry was now on a firm \nfooting.For most of us, the periodic table is a thing of beauty in the abstract, but for chemists it \nestablished an immediate orderliness and clarity that can hardly be overstated. \u201cWithout a \ndoubt, the Periodic Table of the Chemical Elements is the most elegant organizational chart \never devised,\u201d wrote Robert E. Krebs in The History and Use of Our Earth\u2019s Chemical \nElements, and you can find similar sentiments in virtually every history of chemistry in print. \n    Today we have \u201c120 or so\u201d known elements\u2014ninety-two naturally occurring ones plus a \ncouple of dozen that have been created in labs. The actual number is slightly contentious \nbecause the heavy, synthesized elements exist for only millionths of seconds and chemists \nsometimes argue over whether they have really been detected or not. In Mendeleyev\u2019s day \njust sixty-three elements were known, but part of his cleverness was to realize that the \nelements as then known didn\u2019t make a complete picture, that many pieces were missing. His \ntable predicted, with pleasing accuracy, where new elements would slot in when they were \nfound. \n    No one knows, incidentally, how high the number of elements might go, though anything \nbeyond 168 as an atomic weight is considered \u201cpurely speculative,\u201d but what is certain is that \nanything that is found will fit neatly into Mendeleyev\u2019s great scheme. \n  \n    The nineteenth century held one last great surprise for chemists. It began in 1896 when \nHenri Becquerel in Paris carelessly left a packet of uranium salts on a wrapped photographic \nplate in a drawer. When he took the plate out some time later, he was surprised to discover \nthat the salts had burned an impression in it, just as if the plate had been exposed to light. The \nsalts were emitting rays of some sort. \n    Considering the importance of what he had found, Becquerel did a very strange thing: he \nturned the matter over to a graduate student for investigation. Fortunately the student was a \nrecent \u00e9migr\u00e9 from Poland named Marie Curie. Working with her new husband, Pierre, Curie \nfound that certain kinds of rocks poured out constant and extraordinary amounts of energy, \nyet without diminishing in size or changing in any detectable way. What she and her husband \ncouldn\u2019t know\u2014what no one could know until Einstein explained things the following \ndecade\u2014was that the rocks were converting mass into energy in an exceedingly efficient way. \nMarie Curie dubbed the effect \u201cradioactivity.\u201d In the process of their work, the Curies also \nfound two new elements\u2014polonium, which they named after her native country, and radium. \nIn 1903 the Curies and Becquerel were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in physics. (Marie \nCurie would win a second prize, in chemistry, in 1911, the only person to win in both \nchemistry and physics.) \n    At McGill University in Montreal the young New Zealand\u2013born Ernest Rutherford became \ninterested in the new radioactive materials. With a colleague named Frederick Soddy he \ndiscovered that immense reserves of energy were bound up in these small amounts of matter, \nand that the radioactive decay of these reserves could account for most of the Earth\u2019s warmth. \nThey also discovered that radioactive elements decayed into other elements\u2014that one day \nyou had an atom of uranium, say, and the next you had an atom of lead. This was truly \nextraordinary. It was alchemy, pure and simple; no one had ever imagined that such a thing \ncould happen naturally and spontaneously. \n    Ever the pragmatist, Rutherford was the first to see that there could be a valuable practical \napplication in this. He noticed that in any sample of radioactive material, it always took thesame amount of time for half the sample to decay\u2014the celebrated half-life\u2014and that this \nsteady, reliable rate of decay could be used as a kind of clock. By calculating backwards from \nhow much radiation a material had now and how swiftly it was decaying, you could work out \nits age. He tested a piece of pitchblende, the principal ore of uranium, and found it to be 700 \nmillion years old\u2014very much older than the age most people were prepared to grant the \nEarth. \n    In the spring of 1904, Rutherford traveled to London to give a lecture at the Royal \nInstitution\u2014the august organization founded by Count von Rumford only 105 years before, \nthough that powdery and periwigged age now seemed a distant eon compared with the roll-\nyour-sleeves-up robustness of the late Victorians. Rutherford was there to talk about his new \ndisintegration theory of radioactivity, as part of which he brought out his piece of pitchblende. \nTactfully\u2014for the aging Kelvin was present, if not always fully awake\u2014Rutherford noted \nthat Kelvin himself had suggested that the discovery of some other source of heat would \nthrow his calculations out. Rutherford had found that other source. Thanks to radioactivity the \nEarth could be\u2014and self-evidently was\u2014much older than the twenty-four million years \nKelvin\u2019s calculations allowed. \n    Kelvin beamed at Rutherford\u2019s respectful presentation, but was in fact unmoved. He never \naccepted the revised figures and to his dying day believed his work on the age of the Earth his \nmost astute and important contribution to science\u2014far greater than his work on \nthermodynamics. \n    As with most scientific revolutions, Rutherford\u2019s new findings were not universally \naccepted. John Joly of Dublin strenuously insisted well into the 1930s that the Earth was no \nmore than eighty-nine million years old, and was stopped only then by his own death. Others \nbegan to worry that Rutherford had now given them too much time. But even with \nradiometric dating, as decay measurements became known, it would be decades before we got \nwithin a billion years or so of Earth\u2019s actual age. Science was on the right track, but still way \nout. \n    Kelvin died in 1907. That year also saw the death of Dmitri Mendeleyev. Like Kelvin, his \nproductive work was far behind him, but his declining years were notably less serene. As he \naged, Mendeleyev became increasingly eccentric\u2014he refused to acknowledge the existence \nof radiation or the electron or anything else much that was new\u2014and difficult. His final \ndecades were spent mostly storming out of labs and lecture halls all across Europe. In 1955, \nelement 101 was named mendelevium in his honor. \u201cAppropriately,\u201d notes Paul Strathern, \u201cit \nis an unstable element.\u201d \n    Radiation, of course, went on and on, literally and in ways nobody expected. In the early \n1900s Pierre Curie began to experience clear signs of radiation sickness\u2014notably dull aches \nin his bones and chronic feelings of malaise\u2014which doubtless would have progressed \nunpleasantly. We shall never know for certain because in 1906 he was fatally run over by a \ncarriage while crossing a Paris street. \n    Marie Curie spent the rest of her life working with distinction in the field, helping to found \nthe celebrated Radium Institute of the University of Paris in 1914. Despite her two Nobel \nPrizes, she was never elected to the Academy of Sciences, in large part because after the death \nof Pierre she conducted an affair with a married physicist that was sufficiently indiscreet to \nscandalize even the French\u2014or at least the old men who ran the academy, which is perhaps \nanother matter.For a long time it was assumed that anything so miraculously energetic as radioactivity \nmust be beneficial. For years, manufacturers of toothpaste and laxatives put radioactive \nthorium in their products, and at least until the late 1920s the Glen Springs Hotel in the Finger \nLakes region of New York (and doubtless others as well) featured with pride the therapeutic \neffects of its \u201cRadioactive mineral springs.\u201d Radioactivity wasn\u2019t banned in consumer \nproducts until 1938. By this time it was much too late for Madame Curie, who died of \nleukemia in 1934. Radiation, in fact, is so pernicious and long lasting that even now her \npapers from the 1890s\u2014even her cookbooks\u2014are too dangerous to handle. Her lab books are \nkept in lead-lined boxes, and those who wish to see them must don protective clothing. \n    Thanks to the devoted and unwittingly high-risk work of the first atomic scientists, by the \nearly years of the twentieth century it was becoming clear that Earth was unquestionably \nvenerable, though another half century of science would have to be done before anyone could \nconfidently say quite how venerable. Science, meanwhile, was about to get a new age of its \nown\u2014the atomic one.PART  III   A NEW AGE DAWNS \n \n \n \n \nA Physicist is the atoms\u2019 way of thinking about atoms. \n \n \n \n-Anonymous", "8": "8    EINSTEIN\u2019S UNIVERSE \n \n \nAS THE NINETEENTH century drew to a close, scientists could reflect with satisfaction that \nthey had pinned down most of the mysteries of the physical world: electricity, magnetism, \ngases, optics, acoustics, kinetics, and statistical mechanics, to name just a few, all had fallen \ninto order before them. They had discovered the X ray, the cathode ray, the electron, and \nradioactivity, invented the ohm, the watt, the Kelvin, the joule, the amp, and the little erg. \n    If a thing could be oscillated, accelerated, perturbed, distilled, combined, weighed, or made \ngaseous they had done it, and in the process produced a body of universal laws so weighty \nand majestic that we still tend to write them out in capitals: the Electromagnetic Field Theory \nof Light, Richter\u2019s Law of Reciprocal Proportions, Charles\u2019s Law of Gases, the Law of \nCombining Volumes, the Zeroth Law, the Valence Concept, the Laws of Mass Actions, and \nothers beyond counting. The whole world clanged and chuffed with the machinery and \ninstruments that their ingenuity had produced. Many wise people believed that there was \nnothing much left for science to do. \n    In 1875, when a young German in Kiel named Max Planck was deciding whether to devote \nhis life to mathematics or to physics, he was urged most heartily not to choose physics \nbecause the breakthroughs had all been made there. The coming century, he was assured, \nwould be one of consolidation and refinement, not revolution. Planck didn\u2019t listen. He studied \ntheoretical physics and threw himself body and soul into work on entropy, a process at the \nheart of thermodynamics, which seemed to hold much promise for an ambitious young man.1 \nIn 1891 he produced his results and learned to his dismay that the important work on entropy \nhad in fact been done already, in this instance by a retiring scholar at Yale University named \nJ. Willard Gibbs. \n    Gibbs is perhaps the most brilliant person that most people have never heard of. Modest to \nthe point of near invisibility, he passed virtually the whole of his life, apart from three years \nspent studying in Europe, within a three-block area bounded by his house and the Yale \ncampus in New Haven, Connecticut. For his first ten years at Yale he didn\u2019t even bother to \ndraw a salary. (He had independent means.) From 1871, when he joined the university as a \nprofessor, to his death in 1903, his courses attracted an average of slightly over one student a \nsemester. His written work was difficult to follow and employed a private form of notation \nthat many found incomprehensible. But buried among his arcane formulations were insights \nof the loftiest brilliance. \n    In 1875\u201378, Gibbs produced a series of papers, collectively titledOn the Equilibrium of \nHeterogeneous Substances , that dazzlingly elucidated the thermodynamic principles of, well, \n                                                 \n1 Specifically it is a measure of randomness or disorder in a system. Darrell Ebbing, in the textbook General \nChemistry, very usefully suggests thinking of a deck of cards. A new pack fresh out of the box, arranged by suit \nand in sequence from ace to king, can be said to be in its ordered state. Shuffle the cards and you put them in a \ndisordered state. Entropy is a way of measuring just how disordered that state is and of determining the \nlikelihood of particular outcomes with further shuffles. Of course, if you wish to have any observations \npublished in a respectable journal you will need also to understand additional concepts such as thermal \nnonuniformities, lattice distances, and stoichiometric relationships, but that's the general idea.nearly everything\u2014\u201cgases, mixtures, surfaces, solids, phase changes . . . chemical reactions, \nelectrochemical cells, sedimentation, and osmosis,\u201d to quote William H. Cropper. In essence \nwhat Gibbs did was show that thermodynamics didn\u2019t apply simply to heat and energy at the \nsort of large and noisy scale of the steam engine, but was also present and influential at the \natomic level of chemical reactions. Gibbs\u2019s Equilibrium has been called \u201cthe Principia of \nthermodynamics,\u201d but for reasons that defy speculation Gibbs chose to publish these \nlandmark observations in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, \na journal that managed to be obscure even in Connecticut, which is why Planck did not hear \nof him until too late. \n    Undaunted\u2014well, perhaps mildly daunted\u2014Planck turned to other matters.2 We shall turn \nto these ourselves in a moment, but first we must make a slight (but relevant!) detour to \nCleveland, Ohio, and an institution then known as the Case School of Applied Science. There, \nin the 1880s, a physicist of early middle years named Albert Michelson, assisted by his friend \nthe chemist Edward Morley, embarked on a series of experiments that produced curious and \ndisturbing results that would have great ramifications for much of what followed. \n    What Michelson and Morley did, without actually intending to, was undermine a \nlongstanding belief in something called the luminiferous ether, a stable, invisible, weightless, \nfrictionless, and unfortunately wholly imaginary medium that was thought to permeate the \nuniverse. Conceived by Descartes, embraced by Newton, and venerated by nearly everyone \never since, the ether held a position of absolute centrality in nineteenth-century physics as a \nway of explaining how light traveled across the emptiness of space. It was especially needed \nin the 1800s because light and electromagnetism were now seen as waves, which is to say \ntypes of vibrations. Vibrations must occur in something; hence the need for, and lasting \ndevotion to, an ether. As late as 1909, the great British physicist J. J. Thomson was insisting: \n\u201cThe ether is not a fantastic creation of the speculative philosopher; it is as essential to us as \nthe air we breathe\u201d\u2014this more than four years after it was pretty incontestably established \nthat it didn\u2019t exist. People, in short, were really attached to the ether. \n    If you needed to illustrate the idea of nineteenth-century America as a land of opportunity, \nyou could hardly improve on the life of Albert Michelson. Born in 1852 on the German\u2013\nPolish border to a family of poor Jewish merchants, he came to the United States with his \nfamily as an infant and grew up in a mining camp in California\u2019s gold rush country, where his \nfather ran a dry goods business. Too poor to pay for college, he traveled to Washington, D.C., \nand took to loitering by the front door of the White House so that he could fall in beside \nPresident Ulysses S. Grant when the President emerged for his daily constitutional. (It was \nclearly a more innocent age.) In the course of these walks, Michelson so ingratiated himself to \nthe President that Grant agreed to secure for him a free place at the U.S. Naval Academy. It \nwas there that Michelson learned his physics. \n    Ten years later, by now a professor at the Case School in Cleveland, Michelson became \ninterested in trying to measure something called the ether drift\u2014a kind of head wind \nproduced by moving objects as they plowed through space. One of the predictions of \nNewtonian physics was that the speed of light as it pushed through the ether should vary with \n                                                 \n2 Planck was often unlucky in life. His beloved first wife died early, in 1909, and the younger of his two sons \nwas killed in the First World War. He also had twin daughters whom he adored. One died giving birth. The \nsurviving twin went to look after the baby and fell in love with her sister's husband. They married and two years \nlater she died in childbirth. In 1944, when Planck was eighty-five, an Allied bomb fell on his house and he lost \neverything-papers, diaries, a lifetime of accumulations. The following year his surviving son was caught in a \nconspiracy to assassinate Hitler and executed.respect to an observer depending on whether the observer was moving toward the source of \nlight or away from it, but no one had figured out a way to measure this. It occurred to \nMichelson that for half the year the Earth is traveling toward the Sun and for half the year it is \nmoving away from it, and he reasoned that if you took careful enough measurements at \nopposite seasons and compared light\u2019s travel time between the two, you would have your \nanswer. \n    Michelson talked Alexander Graham Bell, newly enriched inventor of the telephone, into \nproviding the funds to build an ingenious and sensitive instrument of Michelson\u2019s own \ndevising called an interferometer, which could measure the velocity of light with great \nprecision. Then, assisted by the genial but shadowy Morley, Michelson embarked on years of \nfastidious measurements. The work was delicate and exhausting, and had to be suspended for \na time to permit Michelson a brief but comprehensive nervous breakdown, but by 1887 they \nhad their results. They were not at all what the two scientists had expected to find. \n    As Caltech astrophysicist Kip S. Thorne has written: \u201cThe speed of light turned out to be \nthe same inall directions and at all seasons.\u201d It was the first hint in two hundred years\u2014in \nexactly two hundred years, in fact\u2014that Newton\u2019s laws might not apply all the time \neverywhere. The Michelson-Morley outcome became, in the words of William H. Cropper, \n\u201cprobably the most famous negative result in the history of physics.\u201d Michelson was awarded \na Nobel Prize in physics for the work\u2014the first American so honored\u2014but not for twenty \nyears. Meanwhile, the Michelson-Morley experiments would hover unpleasantly, like a musty \nsmell, in the background of scientific thought. \n    Remarkably, and despite his findings, when the twentieth century dawned Michelson \ncounted himself among those who believed that the work of science was nearly at an end, \nwith \u201conly a few turrets and pinnacles to be added, a few roof bosses to be carved,\u201d in the \nwords of a writer in Nature. \n    In fact, of course, the world was about to enter a century of science where many people \nwouldn\u2019t understand anything and none would understand everything. Scientists would soon \nfind themselves adrift in a bewildering realm of particles and antiparticles, where things pop \nin and out of existence in spans of time that make nanoseconds look plodding and uneventful, \nwhere everything is strange. Science was moving from a world of macrophysics, where \nobjects could be seen and held and measured, to one of microphysics, where events transpire \nwith unimaginable swiftness on scales far below the limits of imagining. We were about to \nenter the quantum age, and the first person to push on the door was the so-far unfortunate \nMax Planck. \n    In 1900, now a theoretical physicist at the University of Berlin and at the somewhat \nadvanced age of forty-two, Planck unveiled a new \u201cquantum theory,\u201d which posited that \nenergy is not a continuous thing like flowing water but comes in individualized packets, \nwhich he called quanta. This was a novel concept, and a good one. In the short term it would \nhelp to provide a solution to the puzzle of the Michelson-Morley experiments in that it \ndemonstrated that light needn\u2019t be a wave after all. In the longer term it would lay the \nfoundation for the whole of modern physics. It was, at all events, the first clue that the world \nwas about to change. \n    But the landmark event\u2014the dawn of a new age\u2014came in 1905, when there appeared in \nthe German physics journal Annalen der Physik a series of papers by a young Swiss \nbureaucrat who had no university affiliation, no access to a laboratory, and the regular use ofno library greater than that of the national patent office in Bern, where he was employed as a \ntechnical examiner third class. (An application to be promoted to technical examiner second \nclass had recently been rejected.) \n    His name was Albert Einstein, and in that one eventful year he submitted to Annalen der \nPhysik five papers, of which three, according to C. P. Snow, \u201cwere among the greatest in the \nhistory of physics\u201d\u2014one examining the photoelectric effect by means of Planck\u2019s new \nquantum theory, one on the behavior of small particles in suspension (what is known as \nBrownian motion), and one outlining a special theory of relativity. \n    The first won its author a Nobel Prize and explained the nature of light (and also helped to \nmake television possible, among other things).3 The second provided proof that atoms do \nindeed exist\u2014a fact that had, surprisingly, been in some dispute. The third merely changed \nthe world. \n  \n    Einstein was born in Ulm, in southern Germany, in 1879, but grew up in Munich. Little in \nhis early life suggested the greatness to come. Famously he didn\u2019t learn to speak until he was \nthree. In the 1890s, his father\u2019s electrical business failing, the family moved to Milan, but \nAlbert, by now a teenager, went to Switzerland to continue his education\u2014though he failed \nhis college entrance exams on the first try. In 1896 he gave up his German citizenship to \navoid military conscription and entered the Zurich Polytechnic Institute on a four-year course \ndesigned to churn out high school science teachers. He was a bright but not outstanding \nstudent. \n    In 1900 he graduated and within a few months was beginning to contribute papers to \nAnnalen der Physik. His very first paper, on the physics of fluids in drinking straws (of all \nthings), appeared in the same issue as Planck\u2019s quantum theory. From 1902 to 1904 he \nproduced a series of papers on statistical mechanics only to discover that the quietly \nproductive J. Willard Gibbs in Connecticut had done that work as well, in his Elementary \nPrinciples of Statistical Mechanics of 1901. \n    At the same time he had fallen in love with a fellow student, a Hungarian named Mileva \nMaric. In 1901 they had a child out of wedlock, a daughter, who was discreetly put up for \nadoption. Einstein never saw his child. Two years later, he and Maric were married. In \nbetween these events, in 1902, Einstein took a job with the Swiss patent office, where he \nstayed for the next seven years. He enjoyed the work: it was challenging enough to engage his \nmind, but not so challenging as to distract him from his physics. This was the background \nagainst which he produced the special theory of relativity in 1905. \n    Called \u201cOn the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,\u201d it is one of the most extraordinary \nscientific papers ever published, as much for how it was presented as for what it said. It had \nno footnotes or citations, contained almost no mathematics, made no mention of any work \nthat had influenced or preceded it, and acknowledged the help of just one individual, a \n                                                 \n3 Einstein was honored, somewhat vaguely, \"for services to theoretical physics.\" He had to wait sixteen years, till \n1921, to receive the award-quite a long time, all things considered, but nothing at all compared with Frederick \nReines, who detected the neutrino in 1957 but wasn't honored with a Nobel until 1995, thirty-eight years later, or \nthe German Ernst Ruska, who invented the electron microscope in 1932 and received his Nobel Prize in 1986, \nmore than half a century after the fact. Since Nobel Prizes are never awarded posthumously, longevity can be as \nimportant a factor as ingenuity for prizewinners.colleague at the patent office named Michele Besso. It was, wrote C. P. Snow, as if Einstein \n\u201chad reached the conclusions by pure thought, unaided, without listening to the opinions of \nothers. To a surprisingly large extent, that is precisely what he had done.\u201d \n    His famous equation, E =mc2, did not appear with the paper, but came in a brief supplement \nthat followed a few months later. As you will recall from school days, E in the equation stands \nfor energy, m for mass, and c2 for the speed of light squared. \n    In simplest terms, what the equation says is that mass and energy have an equivalence. \nThey are two forms of the same thing: energy is liberated matter; matter is energy waiting to \nhappen. Since c2 (the speed of light times itself) is a truly enormous number, what the \nequation is saying is that there is a huge amount\u2014a really huge amount\u2014of energy bound up \nin every material thing.4  \n    You may not feel outstandingly robust, but if you are an average-sized adult you will \ncontain within your modest frame no less than 7 x 1018joules of potential energy\u2014enough to \nexplode with the force of thirty very large hydrogen bombs, assuming you knew how to \nliberate it and really wished to make a point. Everything has this kind of energy trapped \nwithin it. We\u2019re just not very good at getting it out. Even a uranium bomb\u2014the most \nenergetic thing we have produced yet\u2014releases less than 1 percent of the energy it could \nrelease if only we were more cunning. \n    Among much else, Einstein\u2019s theory explained how radiation worked: how a lump of \nuranium could throw out constant streams of high-level energy without melting away like an \nice cube. (It could do it by converting mass to energy extremely efficiently \u00e0 laE =mc2.) It \nexplained how stars could burn for billions of years without racing through their fuel. (Ditto.) \nAt a stroke, in a simple formula, Einstein endowed geologists and astronomers with the \nluxury of billions of years. Above all, the special theory showed that the speed of light was \nconstant and supreme. Nothing could overtake it. It brought light (no pun intended, exactly) to \nthe very heart of our understanding of the nature of the universe. Not incidentally, it also \nsolved the problem of the luminiferous ether by making it clear that it didn\u2019t exist. Einstein \ngave us a universe that didn\u2019t need it. \n    Physicists as a rule are not overattentive to the pronouncements of Swiss patent office \nclerks, and so, despite the abundance of useful tidings, Einstein\u2019s papers attracted little notice. \nHaving just solved several of the deepest mysteries of the universe, Einstein applied for a job \nas a university lecturer and was rejected, and then as a high school teacher and was rejected \nthere as well. So he went back to his job as an examiner third class, but of course he kept \nthinking. He hadn\u2019t even come close to finishing yet. \n  \n    When the poet Paul Val\u00e9ry once asked Einstein if he kept a notebook to record his ideas, \nEinstein looked at him with mild but genuine surprise. \u201cOh, that\u2019s not necessary,\u201d he replied. \n\u201cIt\u2019s so seldom I have one.\u201d I need hardly point out that when he did get one it tended to be \ngood. Einstein\u2019s next idea was one of the greatest that anyone has ever had\u2014indeed, the very \ngreatest, according to Boorse, Motz, and Weaver in their thoughtful history of atomic science.    \n                                                 \n4 How c came to be the symbol for the speed of light is something of a mystery, but David Bodanis suggests it \nprobably came from the Latin celeritas, meaning swiftness. The relevant volume of the Oxford English \nDictionary, compiled a decade before Einstein's theory, recognizes c as a symbol for many things, from carbon \nto cricket, but makes no mention of it as a symbol for light or swiftness.\u201cAs the creation of a single mind,\u201d they write, \u201cit is undoubtedly the highest intellectual \nachievement of humanity,\u201d which is of course as good as a compliment can get. \n    In 1907, or so it has sometimes been written, Albert Einstein saw a workman fall off a roof \nand began to think about gravity. Alas, like many good stories this one appears to be \napocryphal. According to Einstein himself, he was simply sitting in a chair when the problem \nof gravity occurred to him. \n    Actually, what occurred to Einstein was something more like the beginning of a solution to \nthe problem of gravity, since it had been evident to him from the outset that one thing missing \nfrom the special theory was gravity. What was \u201cspecial\u201d about the special theory was that it \ndealt with things moving in an essentially unimpeded state. But what happened when a thing \nin motion\u2014light, above all\u2014encountered an obstacle such as gravity? It was a question that \nwould occupy his thoughts for most of the next decade and lead to the publication in early \n1917 of a paper entitled \u201cCosmological Considerations on the General Theory of Relativity.\u201d \nThe special theory of relativity of 1905 was a profound and important piece of work, of \ncourse, but as C. P. Snow once observed, if Einstein hadn\u2019t thought of it when he did someone \nelse would have, probably within five years; it was an idea waiting to happen. But the general \ntheory was something else altogether. \u201cWithout it,\u201d wrote Snow in 1979, \u201cit is likely that we \nshould still be waiting for the theory today.\u201d \n    With his pipe, genially self-effacing manner, and electrified hair, Einstein was too splendid \na figure to remain permanently obscure, and in 1919, the war over, the world suddenly \ndiscovered him. Almost at once his theories of relativity developed a reputation for being \nimpossible for an ordinary person to grasp. Matters were not helped, as David Bodanis points \nout in his superb book E=mc2 , when the New York Times decided to do a story, and\u2014for \nreasons that can never fail to excite wonder\u2014sent the paper\u2019s golfing correspondent, one \nHenry Crouch, to conduct the interview. \n    Crouch was hopelessly out of his depth, and got nearly everything wrong. Among the more \nlasting errors in his report was the assertion that Einstein had found a publisher daring enough \nto publish a book that only twelve men \u201cin all the world could comprehend.\u201d There was no \nsuch book, no such publisher, no such circle of learned men, but the notion stuck anyway. \nSoon the number of people who could grasp relativity had been reduced even further in the \npopular imagination\u2014and the scientific establishment, it must be said, did little to disturb the \nmyth. \n    When a journalist asked the British astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington if it was true that he \nwas one of only three people in the world who could understand Einstein\u2019s relativity theories, \nEddington considered deeply for a moment and replied: \u201cI am trying to think who the third \nperson is.\u201d In fact, the problem with relativity wasn\u2019t that it involved a lot of differential \nequations, Lorentz transformations, and other complicated mathematics (though it did\u2014even \nEinstein needed help with some of it), but that it was just so thoroughly nonintuitive. \n    In essence what relativity says is that space and time are not absolute, but relative to both \nthe observer and to the thing being observed, and the faster one moves the more pronounced \nthese effects become. We can never accelerate ourselves to the speed of light, and the harder \nwe try (and faster we go) the more distorted we will become, relative to an outside observer. \n    Almost at once popularizers of science tried to come up with ways to make these concepts \naccessible to a general audience. One of the more successful attempts\u2014commercially atleast\u2014was The ABC of Relativity by the mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell. In \nit, Russell employed an image that has been used many times since. He asked the reader to \nenvision a train one hundred yards long moving at 60 percent of the speed of light. To \nsomeone standing on a platform watching it pass, the train would appear to be only eighty \nyards long and everything on it would be similarly compressed. If we could hear the \npassengers on the train speak, their voices would sound slurred and sluggish, like a record \nplayed at too slow a speed, and their movements would appear similarly ponderous. Even the \nclocks on the train would seem to be running at only four-fifths of their normal speed. \n    However\u2014and here\u2019s the thing\u2014people on the train would have no sense of these \ndistortions. To them, everything on the train would seem quite normal. It would be we on the \nplatform who looked weirdly compressed and slowed down. It is all to do, you see, with your \nposition relative to the moving object. \n    This effect actually happens every time you move. Fly across the United States, and you \nwill step from the plane a quinzillionth of a second, or something, younger than those you left \nbehind. Even in walking across the room you will very slightly alter your own experience of \ntime and space. It has been calculated that a baseball thrown at a hundred miles an hour will \npick up 0.000000000002 grams of mass on its way to home plate. So the effects of relativity \nare real and have been measured. The problem is that such changes are much too small to \nmake the tiniest detectable difference to us. But for other things in the universe\u2014light, \ngravity, the universe itself\u2014these are matters of consequence. \n    So if the ideas of relativity seem weird, it is only because we don\u2019t experience these sorts of \ninteractions in normal life. However, to turn to Bodanis again, we all commonly encounter \nother kinds of relativity\u2014for instance with regard to sound. If you are in a park and someone \nis playing annoying music, you know that if you move to a more distant spot the music will \nseem quieter. That\u2019s not because the musicis quieter, of course, but simply that your position \nrelative to it has changed. To something too small or sluggish to duplicate this experience\u2014a \nsnail, say\u2014the idea that a boom box could seem to two observers to produce two different \nvolumes of music simultaneously might seem incredible. \n    The most challenging and nonintuitive of all the concepts in the general theory of relativity \nis the idea that time is part of space. Our instinct is to regard time as eternal, absolute, \nimmutable\u2014nothing can disturb its steady tick. In fact, according to Einstein, time is variable \nand ever changing. It even has shape. It is bound up\u2014\u201cinextricably interconnected,\u201d in \nStephen Hawking\u2019s expression\u2014with the three dimensions of space in a curious dimension \nknown as spacetime. \n    Spacetime is usually explained by asking you to imagine something flat but pliant\u2014a \nmattress, say, or a sheet of stretched rubber\u2014on which is resting a heavy round object, such \nas an iron ball. The weight of the iron ball causes the material on which it is sitting to stretch \nand sag slightly. This is roughly analogous to the effect that a massive object such as the Sun \n(the iron ball) has on spacetime (the material): it stretches and curves and warps it. Now if \nyou roll a smaller ball across the sheet, it tries to go in a straight line as required by Newton\u2019s \nlaws of motion, but as it nears the massive object and the slope of the sagging fabric, it rolls \ndownward, ineluctably drawn to the more massive object. This is gravity\u2014a product of the \nbending of spacetime. \n    Every object that has mass creates a little depression in the fabric of the cosmos. Thus the \nuniverse, as Dennis Overbye has put it, is \u201cthe ultimate sagging mattress.\u201d Gravity on thisview is no longer so much a thing as an outcome\u2014\u201cnot a \u2018force\u2019 but a byproduct of the \nwarping of spacetime,\u201d in the words of the physicist Michio Kaku, who goes on: \u201cIn some \nsense, gravity does not exist; what moves the planets and stars is the distortion of space and \ntime.\u201d \n    Of course the sagging mattress analogy can take us only so far because it doesn\u2019t \nincorporate the effect of time. But then our brains can take us only so far because it is so \nnearly impossible to envision a dimension comprising three parts space to one part time, all \ninterwoven like the threads in a plaid fabric. At all events, I think we can agree that this was \nan awfully big thought for a young man staring out the window of a patent office in the \ncapital of Switzerland. \n  \n    Among much else, Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity suggested that the universe must \nbe either expanding or contracting. But Einstein was not a cosmologist, and he accepted the \nprevailing wisdom that the universe was fixed and eternal. More or less reflexively, he \ndropped into his equations something called the cosmological constant, which arbitrarily \ncounterbalanced the effects of gravity, serving as a kind of mathematical pause button. Books \non the history of science always forgive Einstein this lapse, but it was actually a fairly \nappalling piece of science and he knew it. He called it \u201cthe biggest blunder of my life.\u201d \n    Coincidentally, at about the time that Einstein was affixing a cosmological constant to his \ntheory, at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, an astronomer with the cheerily intergalactic \nname of Vesto Slipher (who was in fact from Indiana) was taking spectrographic readings of \ndistant stars and discovering that they appeared to be moving away from us. The universe \nwasn\u2019t static. The stars Slipher looked at showed unmistakable signs of a Doppler shift5\u2014the \nsame mechanism behind that distinctive stretched-out yee-yummm sound cars make as they \nflash past on a racetrack. The phenomenon also applies to light, and in the case of receding \ngalaxies it is known as a red shift (because light moving away from us shifts toward the red \nend of the spectrum; approaching light shifts to blue). \n    Slipher was the first to notice this effect with light and to realize its potential importance \nfor understanding the motions of the cosmos. Unfortunately no one much noticed him. The \nLowell Observatory, as you will recall, was a bit of an oddity thanks to Percival Lowell\u2019s \nobsession with Martian canals, which in the 1910s made it, in every sense, an outpost of \nastronomical endeavor. Slipher was unaware of Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, and the world \nwas equally unaware of Slipher. So his finding had no impact. \n    Glory instead would pass to a large mass of ego named Edwin Hubble. Hubble was born in \n1889, ten years after Einstein, in a small Missouri town on the edge of the Ozarks and grew \nup there and in Wheaton, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. His father was a successful insurance \nexecutive, so life was always comfortable, and Edwin enjoyed a wealth of physical \nendowments, too. He was a strong and gifted athlete, charming, smart, and immensely good-\nlooking\u2014\u201chandsome almost to a fault,\u201d in the description of William H. Cropper, \u201can \n                                                 \n5 Named for Johann Christian Doppler, an Austrian physicist, who first noticed the effect in 1842. Briefly, what \nhappens is that as a moving object approaches a stationary one its sound waves become bunched up as they cram \nup against whatever device is receiving them (your ears, say), just as you would expect of anything that is being \npushed from behind toward an immobile object. This bunching is perceived by the listener as a kind of pinched \nand elevated sound (the yee). As the sound source passes, the sound waves spread out and lengthen, causing the \npitch to drop abruptly (the yummm).Adonis\u201d in the words of another admirer. According to his own accounts, he also managed to \nfit into his life more or less constant acts of valor\u2014rescuing drowning swimmers, leading \nfrightened men to safety across the battlefields of France, embarrassing world-champion \nboxers with knockdown punches in exhibition bouts. It all seemed too good to be true. It was. \nFor all his gifts, Hubble was also an inveterate liar. \n    This was more than a little odd, for Hubble\u2019s life was filled from an early age with a level \nof distinction that was at times almost ludicrously golden. At a single high school track meet \nin 1906, he won the pole vault, shot put, discus, hammer throw, standing high jump, and \nrunning high jump, and was on the winning mile-relay team\u2014that is seven first places in one \nmeet\u2014and came in third in the broad jump. In the same year, he set a state record for the high \njump in Illinois. \n    As a scholar he was equally proficient, and had no trouble gaining admission to study \nphysics and astronomy at the University of Chicago (where, coincidentally, the head of the \ndepartment was now Albert Michelson). There he was selected to be one of the first Rhodes \nscholars at Oxford. Three years of English life evidently turned his head, for he returned to \nWheaton in 1913 wearing an Inverness cape, smoking a pipe, and talking with a peculiarly \norotund accent\u2014not quite British but not quite not\u2014that would remain with him for life. \nThough he later claimed to have passed most of the second decade of the century practicing \nlaw in Kentucky, in fact he worked as a high school teacher and basketball coach in New \nAlbany, Indiana, before belatedly attaining his doctorate and passing briefly through the \nArmy. (He arrived in France one month before the Armistice and almost certainly never heard \na shot fired in anger.) \n    In 1919, now aged thirty, he moved to California and took up a position at the Mount \nWilson Observatory near Los Angeles. Swiftly, and more than a little unexpectedly, he \nbecame the most outstanding astronomer of the twentieth century. \n    It is worth pausing for a moment to consider just how little was known of the cosmos at this \ntime. Astronomers today believe there are perhaps 140 billion galaxies in the visible universe. \nThat\u2019s a huge number, much bigger than merely saying it would lead you to suppose. If \ngalaxies were frozen peas, it would be enough to fill a large auditorium\u2014the old Boston \nGarden, say, or the Royal Albert Hall. (An astrophysicist named Bruce Gregory has actually \ncomputed this.) In 1919, when Hubble first put his head to the eyepiece, the number of these \ngalaxies that were known to us was exactly one: the Milky Way. Everything else was thought \nto be either part of the Milky Way itself or one of many distant, peripheral puffs of gas. \nHubble quickly demonstrated how wrong that belief was. \n    Over the next decade, Hubble tackled two of the most fundamental questions of the \nuniverse: how old is it, and how big? To answer both it is necessary to know two things\u2014how \nfar away certain galaxies are and how fast they are flying away from us (what is known as \ntheir recessional velocity). The red shift gives the speed at which galaxies are retiring, but \ndoesn\u2019t tell us how far away they are to begin with. For that you need what are known as \n\u201cstandard candles\u201d\u2014stars whose brightness can be reliably calculated and used as \nbenchmarks to measure the brightness (and hence relative distance) of other stars. \n    Hubble\u2019s luck was to come along soon after an ingenious woman named Henrietta Swan \nLeavitt had figured out a way to do so. Leavitt worked at the Harvard College Observatory as \na computer, as they were known. Computers spent their lives studying photographic plates of \nstars and making computations\u2014hence the name. It was little more than drudgery by anothername, but it was as close as women could get to real astronomy at Harvard\u2014or indeed pretty \nmuch anywhere\u2014in those days. The system, however unfair, did have certain unexpected \nbenefits: it meant that half the finest minds available were directed to work that would \notherwise have attracted little reflective attention, and it ensured that women ended up with an \nappreciation of the fine structure of the cosmos that often eluded their male counterparts. \n    One Harvard computer, Annie Jump Cannon, used her repetitive acquaintance with the \nstars to devise a system of stellar classifications so practical that it is still in use today. \nLeavitt\u2019s contribution was even more profound. She noticed that a type of star known as a \nCepheid variable (after the constellation Cepheus, where it first was identified) pulsated with \na regular rhythm\u2014a kind of stellar heartbeat. Cepheids are quite rare, but at least one of them \nis well known to most of us. Polaris, the Pole Star, is a Cepheid. \n    We now know that Cepheids throb as they do because they are elderly stars that have \nmoved past their \u201cmain sequence phase,\u201d in the parlance of astronomers, and become red \ngiants. The chemistry of red giants is a little weighty for our purposes here (it requires an \nappreciation for the properties of singly ionized helium atoms, among quite a lot else), but put \nsimply it means that they burn their remaining fuel in a way that produces a very rhythmic, \nvery reliable brightening and dimming. Leavitt\u2019s genius was to realize that by comparing the \nrelative magnitudes of Cepheids at different points in the sky you could work out where they \nwere in relation to each other. They could be used as \u201cstandard candles\u201d\u2014a term she coined \nand still in universal use. The method provided only relative distances, not absolute distances, \nbut even so it was the first time that anyone had come up with a usable way to measure the \nlarge-scale universe. \n    (Just to put these insights into perspective, it is perhaps worth noting that at the time Leavitt \nand Cannon were inferring fundamental properties of the cosmos from dim smudges on \nphotographic plates, the Harvard astronomer William H. Pickering, who could of course peer \ninto a first-class telescope as often as he wanted, was developing his seminal theory that dark \npatches on the Moon were caused by swarms of seasonally migrating insects.) \n    Combining Leavitt\u2019s cosmic yardstick with Vesto Slipher\u2019s handy red shifts, Edwin Hubble \nnow began to measure selected points in space with a fresh eye. In 1923 he showed that a puff \nof distant gossamer in the Andromeda constellation known as M31 wasn\u2019t a gas cloud at all \nbut a blaze of stars, a galaxy in its own right, a hundred thousand light-years across and at \nleast nine hundred thousand light-years away. The universe was vaster\u2014vastly vaster\u2014than \nanyone had ever supposed. In 1924 he produced a landmark paper, \u201cCepheids in Spiral \nNebulae\u201d (nebulae,from the Latin for \u201cclouds,\u201d was his word for galaxies), showing that the \nuniverse consisted not just of the Milky Way but of lots of independent galaxies\u2014\u201cisland \nuniverses\u201d\u2014many of them bigger than the Milky Way and much more distant. \n    This finding alone would have ensured Hubble\u2019s reputation, but he now turned to the \nquestion of working out just how much vaster the universe was, and made an even more \nstriking discovery. Hubble began to measure the spectra of distant galaxies\u2014the business that \nSlipher had begun in Arizona. Using Mount Wilson\u2019s new hundred-inch Hooker telescope \nand some clever inferences, he worked out that all the galaxies in the sky (except for our own \nlocal cluster) are moving away from us. Moreover, their speed and distance were neatly \nproportional: the further away the galaxy, the faster it was moving. \n    This was truly startling. The universe was expanding, swiftly and evenly in all directions. It \ndidn\u2019t take a huge amount of imagination to read backwards from this and realize that it musttherefore have started from some central point. Far from being the stable, fixed, eternal void \nthat everyone had always assumed, this was a universe that had a beginning. It might \ntherefore also have an end. \n    The wonder, as Stephen Hawking has noted, is that no one had hit on the idea of the \nexpanding universe before. A static universe, as should have been obvious to Newton and \nevery thinking astronomer since, would collapse in upon itself. There was also the problem \nthat if stars had been burning indefinitely in a static universe they\u2019d have made the whole \nintolerably hot\u2014certainly much too hot for the likes of us. An expanding universe resolved \nmuch of this at a stroke. \n    Hubble was a much better observer than a thinker and didn\u2019t immediately appreciate the \nfull implications of what he had found. Partly this was because he was woefully ignorant of \nEinstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity. This was quite remarkable because, for one thing, \nEinstein and his theory were world famous by now. Moreover, in 1929 Albert Michelson\u2014\nnow in his twilight years but still one of the world\u2019s most alert and esteemed scientists\u2014\naccepted a position at Mount Wilson to measure the velocity of light with his trusty \ninterferometer, and must surely have at least mentioned to him the applicability of Einstein\u2019s \ntheory to his own findings. \n    At all events, Hubble failed to make theoretical hay when the chance was there. Instead, it \nwas left to a Belgian priest-scholar (with a Ph.D. from MIT) named Georges Lema\u00eetre to \nbring together the two strands in his own \u201cfireworks theory,\u201d which suggested that the \nuniverse began as a geometrical point, a \u201cprimeval atom,\u201d which burst into glory and had \nbeen moving apart ever since. It was an idea that very neatly anticipated the modern \nconception of the Big Bang but was so far ahead of its time that Lema\u00eetre seldom gets more \nthan the sentence or two that we have given him here. The world would need additional \ndecades, and the inadvertent discovery of cosmic background radiation by Penzias and Wilson \nat their hissing antenna in New Jersey, before the Big Bang would begin to move from \ninteresting idea to established theory. \n    Neither Hubble nor Einstein would be much of a part of that big story. Though no one \nwould have guessed it at the time, both men had done about as much as they were ever going \nto do. \n    In 1936 Hubble produced a popular book called The Realm of the Nebulae, which \nexplained in flattering style his own considerable achievements. Here at last he showed that \nhe had acquainted himself with Einstein\u2019s theory\u2014up to a point anyway: he gave it four pages \nout of about two hundred. \n    Hubble died of a heart attack in 1953. One last small oddity awaited him. For reasons \ncloaked in mystery, his wife declined to have a funeral and never revealed what she did with \nhis body. Half a century later the whereabouts of the century\u2019s greatest astronomer remain \nunknown. For a memorial you must look to the sky and the Hubble Space Telescope, \nlaunched in 1990 and named in his honor.", "9": "9    THE MIGHTY ATOM \nWHILE EINSTEIN AND Hubble were productively unraveling the large-scale structure of \nthe cosmos, others were struggling to understand something closer to hand but in its way just \nas remote: the tiny and ever- mysterious atom. \n    The great Caltech physicist Richard Feynman once observed that if you had to reduce \nscientific history to one important statement it would be \u201cAll things are made of atoms.\u201d They \nare everywhere and they constitute every thing. Look around you. It is all atoms. Not just the \nsolid things like walls and tables and sofas, but the air in between. And they are there in \nnumbers that you really cannot conceive. \n    The basic working arrangement of atoms is the molecule (from the Latin for \u201clittle mass\u201d). \nA molecule is simply two or more atoms working together in a more or less stable \narrangement: add two atoms of hydrogen to one of oxygen and you have a molecule of water. \nChemists tend to think in terms of molecules rather than elements in much the way that \nwriters tend to think in terms of words and not letters, so it is molecules they count, and these \nare numerous to say the least. At sea level, at a temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit, one \ncubic centimeter of air (that is, a space about the size of a sugar cube) will contain 45 billion \nbillion molecules. And they are in every single cubic centimeter you see around you. Think \nhow many cubic centimeters there are in the world outside your window\u2014how many sugar \ncubes it would take to fill that view. Then think how many it would take to build a universe. \nAtoms, in short, are very abundant. \n    They are also fantastically durable. Because they are so long lived, atoms really get around. \nEvery atom you possess has almost certainly passed through several stars and been part of \nmillions of organisms on its way to becoming you. We are each so atomically numerous and \nso vigorously recycled at death that a significant number of our atoms\u2014up to a billion for \neach of us, it has been suggested\u2014probably once belonged to Shakespeare. A billion more \neach came from Buddha and Genghis Khan and Beethoven, and any other historical figure \nyou care to name. (The personages have to be historical, apparently, as it takes the atoms \nsome decades to become thoroughly redistributed; however much you may wish it, you are \nnot yet one with Elvis Presley.) \n    So we are all reincarnations\u2014though short-lived ones. When we die our atoms will \ndisassemble and move off to find new uses elsewhere\u2014as part of a leaf or other human being \nor drop of dew. Atoms, however, go on practically forever. Nobody actually knows how long \nan atom can survive, but according to Martin Rees it is probably about 1035years\u2014a number \nso big that even I am happy to express it in notation. \n    Above all, atoms are tiny\u2014very tiny indeed. Half a million of them lined up shoulder to \nshoulder could hide behind a human hair. On such a scale an individual atom is essentially \nimpossible to imagine, but we can of course try. \n    Start with a millimeter, which is a line this long: -. Now imagine that line divided into a \nthousand equal widths. Each of those widths is a micron. This is the scale of microorganisms. \nA typical paramecium, for instance, is about two microns wide, 0.002 millimeters, which is \nreally very small. If you wanted to see with your naked eye a paramecium swimming in a \ndrop of water, you would have to enlarge the drop until it was some forty feet across. \nHowever, if you wanted to see the atoms in the same drop, you would have to make the drop \nfifteen miles across.Atoms, in other words, exist on a scale of minuteness of another order altogether. To get \ndown to the scale of atoms, you would need to take each one of those micron slices and shave \nit into ten thousand finer widths. That\u2019s the scale of an atom: one ten-millionth of a \nmillimeter. It is a degree of slenderness way beyond the capacity of our imaginations, but you \ncan get some idea of the proportions if you bear in mind that one atom is to the width of a \nmillimeter line as the thickness of a sheet of paper is to the height of the Empire State \nBuilding. \n    It is of course the abundance and extreme durability of atoms that makes them so useful, \nand the tininess that makes them so hard to detect and understand. The realization that atoms \nare these three things\u2014small, numerous, practically indestructible\u2014and that all things are \nmade from them first occurred not to Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, as you might expect, or even \nto Henry Cavendish or Humphry Davy, but rather to a spare and lightly educated English \nQuaker named John Dalton, whom we first encountered in the chapter on chemistry. \n    Dalton was born in 1766 on the edge of the Lake District near Cockermouth to a family of \npoor but devout Quaker weavers. (Four years later the poet William Wordsworth would also \njoin the world at Cockermouth.) He was an exceptionally bright student\u2014so very bright \nindeed that at the improbably youthful age of twelve he was put in charge of the local Quaker \nschool. This perhaps says as much about the school as about Dalton\u2019s precocity, but perhaps \nnot: we know from his diaries that at about this time he was reading Newton\u2019s Principia in the \noriginal Latin and other works of a similarly challenging nature. At fifteen, still \nschoolmastering, he took a job in the nearby town of Kendal, and a decade after that he \nmoved to Manchester, scarcely stirring from there for the remaining fifty years of his life. In \nManchester he became something of an intellectual whirlwind, producing books and papers \non subjects ranging from meteorology to grammar. Color blindness, a condition from which \nhe suffered, was for a long time called Daltonism because of his studies. But it was a plump \nbook called A New System of Chemical Philosophy, published in 1808, that established his \nreputation. \n    There, in a short chapter of just five pages (out of the book\u2019s more than nine hundred), \npeople of learning first encountered atoms in something approaching their modern \nconception. Dalton\u2019s simple insight was that at the root of all matter are exceedingly tiny, \nirreducible particles. \u201cWe might as well attempt to introduce a new planet into the solar \nsystem or annihilate one already in existence, as to create or destroy a particle of hydrogen,\u201d \nhe wrote. \n    Neither the idea of atoms nor the term itself was exactly new. Both had been developed by \nthe ancient Greeks. Dalton\u2019s contribution was to consider the relative sizes and characters of \nthese atoms and how they fit together. He knew, for instance, that hydrogen was the lightest \nelement, so he gave it an atomic weight of one. He believed also that water consisted of seven \nparts of oxygen to one of hydrogen, and so he gave oxygen an atomic weight of seven. By \nsuch means was he able to arrive at the relative weights of the known elements. He wasn\u2019t \nalways terribly accurate\u2014oxygen\u2019s atomic weight is actually sixteen, not seven\u2014but the \nprinciple was sound and formed the basis for all of modern chemistry and much of the rest of \nmodern science. \n    The work made Dalton famous\u2014albeit in a low-key, English Quaker sort of way. In 1826, \nthe French chemist P .J. Pelletier traveled to Manchester to meet the atomic hero. Pelletier \nexpected to find him attached to some grand institution, so he was astounded to discover him \nteaching elementary arithmetic to boys in a small school on a back street. According to thescientific historian E. J. Holmyard, a confused Pelletier, upon beholding the great man, \nstammered: \n \n    \n \u201cEst-ce que j\u2019ai l\u2019honneur de m\u2019addresser \u00e0 Monsieur Dalton?\u201d for he could \nhardly believe his eyes that this was the chemist of European fame, teaching a boy \nhis first four rules. \u201cYes,\u201d said the matter-of-fact Quaker. \u201cWilt thou sit down \nwhilst I put this lad right about his arithmetic?\u201d \n \n    Although Dalton tried to avoid all honors, he was elected to the Royal Society against his \nwishes, showered with medals, and given a handsome government pension. When he died in \n1844, forty thousand people viewed the coffin, and the funeral cortege stretched for two \nmiles. His entry in the Dictionary of National Biography is one of the longest, rivaled in \nlength only by those of Darwin and Lyell among nineteenth-century men of science. \n    For a century after Dalton made his proposal, it remained entirely hypothetical, and a few \neminent scientists\u2014notably the Viennese physicist Ernst Mach, for whom is named the speed \nof sound\u2014doubted the existence of atoms at all. \u201cAtoms cannot be perceived by the senses . . \n. they are things of thought,\u201d he wrote. The existence of atoms was so doubtfully held in the \nGerman-speaking world in particular that it was said to have played a part in the suicide of the \ngreat theoretical physicist, and atomic enthusiast, Ludwig Boltzmann in 1906. \n    It was Einstein who provided the first incontrovertible evidence of atoms\u2019 existence with \nhis paper on Brownian motion in 1905, but this attracted little attention and in any case \nEinstein was soon to become consumed with his work on general relativity. So the first real \nhero of the atomic age, if not the first personage on the scene, was Ernest Rutherford. \n    Rutherford was born in 1871 in the \u201cback blocks\u201d of New Zealand to parents who had \nemigrated from Scotland to raise a little flax and a lot of children (to paraphrase Steven \nWeinberg). Growing up in a remote part of a remote country, he was about as far from the \nmainstream of science as it was possible to be, but in 1895 he won a scholarship that took him \nto the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, which was about to become the hottest \nplace in the world to do physics. \n  \n    Physicists are notoriously scornful of scientists from other fields. When the wife of the \ngreat Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli left him for a chemist, he was staggered with \ndisbelief. \u201cHad she taken a bullfighter I would have understood,\u201d he remarked in wonder to a \nfriend. \u201cBut a chemist . . .\u201d \n    It was a feeling Rutherford would have understood. \u201cAll science is either physics or stamp \ncollecting,\u201d he once said, in a line that has been used many times since. There is a certain \nengaging irony therefore that when he won the Nobel Prize in 1908, it was in chemistry, not \nphysics.Rutherford was a lucky man\u2014lucky to be a genius, but even luckier to live at a time when \nphysics and chemistry were so exciting and so compatible (his own sentiments \nnotwithstanding). Never again would they quite so comfortably overlap. \n    For all his success, Rutherford was not an especially brilliant man and was actually pretty \nterrible at mathematics. Often during lectures he would get so lost in his own equations that \nhe would give up halfway through and tell the students to work it out for themselves. \nAccording to his longtime colleague James Chadwick, discoverer of the neutron, he wasn\u2019t \neven particularly clever at experimentation. He was simply tenacious and open-minded. For \nbrilliance he substituted shrewdness and a kind of daring. His mind, in the words of one \nbiographer, was \u201calways operating out towards the frontiers, as far as he could see, and that \nwas a great deal further than most other men.\u201d Confronted with an intractable problem, he \nwas prepared to work at it harder and longer than most people and to be more receptive to \nunorthodox explanations. His greatest breakthrough came because he was prepared to spend \nimmensely tedious hours sitting at a screen counting alpha particle scintillations, as they were \nknown\u2014the sort of work that would normally have been farmed out. He was one of the first \nto see\u2014possibly the very first\u2014that the power inherent in the atom could, if harnessed, make \nbombs powerful enough to \u201cmake this old world vanish in smoke.\u201d \n    Physically he was big and booming, with a voice that made the timid shrink. Once when \ntold that Rutherford was about to make a radio broadcast across the Atlantic, a colleague drily \nasked: \u201cWhy use radio?\u201d He also had a huge amount of good-natured confidence. When \nsomeone remarked to him that he seemed always to be at the crest of a wave, he responded, \n\u201cWell, after all, I made the wave, didn\u2019t I?\u201d C. P. Snow recalled how once in a Cambridge \ntailor\u2019s he overheard Rutherford remark: \u201cEvery day I grow in girth. And in mentality.\u201d \n    But both girth and fame were far ahead of him in 1895 when he fetched up at the \nCavendish.1 It was a singularly eventful period in science. In the year of his arrival in \nCambridge, Wilhelm Roentgen discovered X rays at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany, \nand the next year Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity. And the Cavendish itself was \nabout to embark on a long period of greatness. In 1897, J. J. Thomson and colleagues would \ndiscover the electron there, in 1911 C. T. R. Wilson would produce the first particle detector \nthere (as we shall see), and in 1932 James Chadwick would discover the neutron there. \nFurther still in the future, James Watson and Francis Crick would discover the structure of \nDNA at the Cavendish in 1953. \n    In the beginning Rutherford worked on radio waves, and with some distinction\u2014he \nmanaged to transmit a crisp signal more than a mile, a very reasonable achievement for the \ntime\u2014but gave it up when he was persuaded by a senior colleague that radio had little future. \nOn the whole, however, Rutherford didn\u2019t thrive at the Cavendish. After three years there, \nfeeling he was going nowhere, he took a post at McGill University in Montreal, and there he \nbegan his long and steady rise to greatness. By the time he received his Nobel Prize (for \n\u201cinvestigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive \nsubstances,\u201d according to the official citation) he had moved on to Manchester University, \nand it was there, in fact, that he would do his most important work in determining the \nstructure and nature of the atom. \n                                                 \n1 The name comes from the same Cavendishes who producec Henry. This one was William Cavendish, seventh \nDuke of Devonshire, who was a gifted mathematician and steel baron in Victoriar England. In 1870, he gave the \nuniversity \u00a36,300 to build an experimental lab.By the early twentieth century it was known that atoms were made of parts\u2014Thomson\u2019s \ndiscovery of the electron had established that\u2014but it wasn\u2019t known how many parts there \nwere or how they fit together or what shape they took. Some physicists thought that atoms \nmight be cube shaped, because cubes can be packed together so neatly without any wasted \nspace. The more general view, however, was that an atom was more like a currant bun or a \nplum pudding: a dense, solid object that carried a positive charge but that was studded with \nnegatively charged electrons, like the currants in a currant bun. \n    In 1910, Rutherford (assisted by his student Hans Geiger, who would later invent the \nradiation detector that bears his name) fired ionized helium atoms, or alpha particles, at a \nsheet of gold foil.2 To Rutherford\u2019s astonishment, some of the particles bounced back. It was \nas if, he said, he had fired a fifteen-inch shell at a sheet of paper and it rebounded into his lap. \nThis was just not supposed to happen. After considerable reflection he realized there could be \nonly one possible explanation: the particles that bounced back were striking something small \nand dense at the heart of the atom, while the other particles sailed through unimpeded. An \natom, Rutherford realized, was mostly empty space, with a very dense nucleus at the center. \nThis was a most gratifying discovery, but it presented one immediate problem. By all the laws \nof conventional physics, atoms shouldn\u2019t therefore exist. \n  \n    Let us pause for a moment and consider the structure of the atom as we know it now. Every \natom is made from three kinds of elementary particles: protons, which have a positive \nelectrical charge; electrons, which have a negative electrical charge; and neutrons, which have \nno charge. Protons and neutrons are packed into the nucleus, while electrons spin around \noutside. The number of protons is what gives an atom its chemical identity. An atom with one \nproton is an atom of hydrogen, one with two protons is helium, with three protons is lithium, \nand so on up the scale. Each time you add a proton you get a new element. (Because the \nnumber of protons in an atom is always balanced by an equal number of electrons, you will \nsometimes see it written that it is the number of electrons that defines an element; it comes to \nthe same thing. The way it was explained to me is that protons give an atom its identity, \nelectrons its personality.) \n    Neutrons don\u2019t influence an atom\u2019s identity, but they do add to its mass. The number of \nneutrons is generally about the same as the number of protons, but they can vary up and down \nslightly. Add a neutron or two and you get an isotope. The terms you hear in reference to \ndating techniques in archeology refer to isotopes\u2014carbon-14, for instance, which is an atom \nof carbon with six protons and eight neutrons (the fourteen being the sum of the two). \n    Neutrons and protons occupy the atom\u2019s nucleus. The nucleus of an atom is tiny\u2014only one \nmillionth of a billionth of the full volume of the atom\u2014but fantastically dense, since it \ncontains virtually all the atom\u2019s mass. As Cropper has put it, if an atom were expanded to the \nsize of a cathedral, the nucleus would be only about the size of a fly\u2014but a fly many \nthousands of times heavier than the cathedral. It was this spaciousness\u2014this resounding, \nunexpected roominess\u2014that had Rutherford scratching his head in 1910. \n    It is still a fairly astounding notion to consider that atoms are mostly empty space, and that \nthe solidity we experience all around us is an illusion. When two objects come together in the \n                                                 \n2 Geiger would also later become a loyal Nazi, unhesitatingly betraying Jewish colleagues, including many who \nhad helped him.real world\u2014billiard balls are most often used for illustration\u2014they don\u2019t actually strike each \nother. \u201cRather,\u201d as Timothy Ferris explains, \u201cthe negatively charged fields of the two balls \nrepel each other . . . were it not for their electrical charges they could, like galaxies, pass right \nthrough each other unscathed.\u201d When you sit in a chair, you are not actually sitting there, but \nlevitating above it at a height of one angstrom (a hundred millionth of a centimeter), your \nelectrons and its electrons implacably opposed to any closer intimacy. \n    The picture that nearly everybody has in mind of an atom is of an electron or two flying \naround a nucleus, like planets orbiting a sun. This image was created in 1904, based on little \nmore than clever guesswork, by a Japanese physicist named Hantaro Nagaoka. It is \ncompletely wrong, but durable just the same. As Isaac Asimov liked to note, it inspired \ngenerations of science fiction writers to create stories of worlds within worlds, in which atoms \nbecome tiny inhabited solar systems or our solar system turns out to be merely a mote in some \nmuch larger scheme. Even now CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, uses \nNagaoka\u2019s image as a logo on its website. In fact, as physicists were soon to realize, electrons \nare not like orbiting planets at all, but more like the blades of a spinning fan, managing to fill \nevery bit of space in their orbits simultaneously (but with the crucial difference that the blades \nof a fan only seem to be everywhere at once; electrons are ). \n  \n    Needless to say, very little of this was understood in 1910 or for many years afterward. \nRutherford\u2019s finding presented some large and immediate problems, not least that no electron \nshould be able to orbit a nucleus without crashing. Conventional electrodynamic theory \ndemanded that a flying electron should very quickly run out of energy\u2014in only an instant or \nso\u2014and spiral into the nucleus, with disastrous consequences for both. There was also the \nproblem of how protons with their positive charges could bundle together inside the nucleus \nwithout blowing themselves and the rest of the atom apart. Clearly whatever was going on \ndown there in the world of the very small was not governed by the laws that applied in the \nmacro world where our expectations reside. \n     As physicists began to delve into this subatomic realm, they realized that it wasn\u2019t merely \ndifferent from anything we knew, but different from anything ever imagined. \u201cBecause \natomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience,\u201d Richard Feynman once observed, \u201cit is \nvery difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the \nnovice and to the experienced physicist.\u201d When Feynman made that comment, physicists had \nhad half a century to adjust to the strangeness of atomic behavior. So think how it must have \nfelt to Rutherford and his colleagues in the early 1910s when it was all brand new. \n    One of the people working with Rutherford was a mild and affable young Dane named \nNiels Bohr. In 1913, while puzzling over the structure of the atom, Bohr had an idea so \nexciting that he postponed his honeymoon to write what became a landmark paper. Because \nphysicists couldn\u2019t see anything so small as an atom, they had to try to work out its structure \nfrom how it behaved when they did things to it, as Rutherford had done by firing alpha \nparticles at foil. Sometimes, not surprisingly, the results of these experiments were puzzling. \nOne puzzle that had been around for a long time had to do with spectrum readings of the \nwavelengths of hydrogen. These produced patterns showing that hydrogen atoms emitted \nenergy at certain wavelengths but not others. It was rather as if someone under surveillance \nkept turning up at particular locations but was never observed traveling between them. No one \ncould understand why this should be.It was while puzzling over this problem that Bohr was struck by a solution and dashed off \nhis famous paper. Called \u201cOn the Constitutions of Atoms and Molecules,\u201d the paper explained \nhow electrons could keep from falling into the nucleus by suggesting that they could occupy \nonly certain well-defined orbits. According to the new theory, an electron moving between \norbits would disappear from one and reappear instantaneously in another without visiting the \nspace between. This idea\u2014the famous \u201cquantum leap\u201d\u2014is of course utterly strange, but it \nwas too good not to be true. It not only kept electrons from spiraling catastrophically into the \nnucleus; it also explained hydrogen\u2019s bewildering wavelengths. The electrons only appeared \nin certain orbits because they only existed in certain orbits. It was a dazzling insight, and it \nwon Bohr the 1922 Nobel Prize in physics, the year after Einstein received his. \n    Meanwhile the tireless Rutherford, now back at Cambridge as J. J. Thomson\u2019s successor as \nhead of the Cavendish Laboratory, came up with a model that explained why the nuclei didn\u2019t \nblow up. He saw that they must be offset by some type of neutralizing particles, which he \ncalled neutrons. The idea was simple and appealing, but not easy to prove. Rutherford\u2019s \nassociate, James Chadwick, devoted eleven intensive years to hunting for neutrons before \nfinally succeeding in 1932. He, too, was awarded with a Nobel Prize in physics, in 1935. As \nBoorse and his colleagues point out in their history of the subject, the delay in discovery was \nprobably a very good thing as mastery of the neutron was essential to the development of the \natomic bomb. (Because neutrons have no charge, they aren\u2019t repelled by the electrical fields at \nthe heart of an atom and thus could be fired like tiny torpedoes into an atomic nucleus, setting \noff the destructive process known as fission.) Had the neutron been isolated in the 1920s, they \nnote, it is \u201cvery likely the atomic bomb would have been developed first in Europe, \nundoubtedly by the Germans.\u201d \n    As it was, the Europeans had their hands full trying to understand the strange behavior of \nthe electron. The principal problem they faced was that the electron sometimes behaved like a \nparticle and sometimes like a wave. This impossible duality drove physicists nearly mad. For \nthe next decade all across Europe they furiously thought and scribbled and offered competing \nhypotheses. In France, Prince Louis-Victor de Broglie, the scion of a ducal family, found that \ncertain anomalies in the behavior of electrons disappeared when one regarded them as waves. \nThe observation excited the attention of the Austrian Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, who made some deft \nrefinements and devised a handy system called wave mechanics. At almost the same time the \nGerman physicist Werner Heisenberg came up with a competing theory called matrix \nmechanics. This was so mathematically complex that hardly anyone really understood it, \nincluding Heisenberg himself (\u201cI do not even know what a matrix is ,\u201d Heisenberg despaired \nto a friend at one point), but it did seem to solve certain problems that Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s waves \nfailed to explain. The upshot is that physics had two theories, based on conflicting premises, \nthat produced the same results. It was an impossible situation. \n    Finally, in 1926, Heisenberg came up with a celebrated compromise, producing a new \ndiscipline that came to be known as quantum mechanics. At the heart of it was Heisenberg\u2019s \nUncertainty Principle, which states that the electron is a particle but a particle that can be \ndescribed in terms of waves. The uncertainty around which the theory is built is that we can \nknow the path an electron takes as it moves through a space or we can know where it is at a \ngiven instant, but we cannot know both.3 Any attempt to measure one will unavoidably \n                                                 \n3 There is a little uncertainty about the use of the word uncertainty in regard to Heisenberg's principle. Michael \nFrayn, in an afterword to his play Copenhagen, notes that several words in German-Unsicherheit, Unscharfe, \nUnbestimmtheit-have been used by various translators, but that none quite equates to the English uncertainty. \nFrayn suggests that indeterminacy would be a better word for the principle and indeterminability would be better \nstill.disturb the other. This isn\u2019t a matter of simply needing more precise instruments; it is an \nimmutable property of the universe. \n    What this means in practice is that you can never predict where an electron will be at any \ngiven moment. You can only list its probability of being there. In a sense, as Dennis Overbye \nhas put it, an electron doesn\u2019t exist until it is observed. Or, put slightly differently, until it is \nobserved an electron must be regarded as being \u201cat once everywhere and nowhere.\u201d \n    If this seems confusing, you may take some comfort in knowing that it was confusing to \nphysicists, too. Overbye notes: \u201cBohr once commented that a person who wasn\u2019t outraged on \nfirst hearing about quantum theory didn\u2019t understand what had been said.\u201d Heisenberg, when \nasked how one could envision an atom, replied: \u201cDon\u2019t try.\u201d \n    So the atom turned out to be quite unlike the image that most people had created. The \nelectron doesn\u2019t fly around the nucleus like a planet around its sun, but instead takes on the \nmore amorphous aspect of a cloud. The \u201cshell\u201d of an atom isn\u2019t some hard shiny casing, as \nillustrations sometimes encourage us to suppose, but simply the outermost of these fuzzy \nelectron clouds. The cloud itself is essentially just a zone of statistical probability marking the \narea beyond which the electron only very seldom strays. Thus an atom, if you could see it, \nwould look more like a very fuzzy tennis ball than a hard-edged metallic sphere (but not much \nlike either or, indeed, like anything you\u2019ve ever seen; we are, after all, dealing here with a \nworld very different from the one we see around us). \n    It seemed as if there was no end of strangeness. For the first time, as James Trefil has put it, \nscientists had encountered \u201can area of the universe that our brains just aren\u2019t wired to \nunderstand.\u201d Or as Feynman expressed it, \u201cthings on a small scale behave nothing like things \non a large scale.\u201d As physicists delved deeper, they realized they had found a world where not \nonly could electrons jump from one orbit to another without traveling across any intervening \nspace, but matter could pop into existence from nothing at all\u2014\u201cprovided,\u201d in the words of \nAlan Lightman of MIT, \u201cit disappears again with sufficient haste.\u201d \n    Perhaps the most arresting of quantum improbabilities is the idea, arising from Wolfgang \nPauli\u2019s Exclusion Principle of 1925, that the subatomic particles in certain pairs, even when \nseparated by the most considerable distances, can each instantly \u201cknow\u201d what the other is \ndoing. Particles have a quality known as spin and, according to quantum theory, the moment \nyou determine the spin of one particle, its sister particle, no matter how distant away, will \nimmediately begin spinning in the opposite direction and at the same rate. \n    It is as if, in the words of the science writer Lawrence Joseph, you had two identical pool \nballs, one in Ohio and the other in Fiji, and the instant you sent one spinning the other would \nimmediately spin in a contrary direction at precisely the same speed. Remarkably, the \nphenomenon was proved in 1997 when physicists at the University of Geneva sent photons \nseven miles in opposite directions and demonstrated that interfering with one provoked an \ninstantaneous response in the other. \n    Things reached such a pitch that at one conference Bohr remarked of a new theory that the \nquestion was not whether it was crazy, but whether it was crazy enough. To illustrate the \nnonintuitive nature of the quantum world, Schr\u00f6dinger offered a famous thought experiment \nin which a hypothetical cat was placed in a box with one atom of a radioactive substance \nattached to a vial of hydrocyanic acid. If the particle degraded within an hour, it would trigger \na mechanism that would break the vial and poison the cat. If not, the cat would live. But wecould not know which was the case, so there was no choice, scientifically, but to regard the \ncat as 100 percent alive and 100 percent dead at the same time. This means, as Stephen \nHawking has observed with a touch of understandable excitement, that one cannot \u201cpredict \nfuture events exactly if one cannot even measure the present state of the universe precisely!\u201d \n    Because of its oddities, many physicists disliked quantum theory, or at least certain aspects \nof it, and none more so than Einstein. This was more than a little ironic since it was he, in his \nannus mirabilis of 1905, who had so persuasively explained how photons of light could \nsometimes behave like particles and sometimes like waves\u2014the notion at the very heart of the \nnew physics. \u201cQuantum theory is very worthy of regard,\u201d he observed politely, but he really \ndidn\u2019t like it. \u201cGod doesn\u2019t play dice,\u201d he said.4  \n    Einstein couldn\u2019t bear the notion that God could create a universe in which some things \nwere forever unknowable. Moreover, the idea of action at a distance\u2014that one particle could \ninstantaneously influence another trillions of miles away\u2014was a stark violation of the special \ntheory of relativity. This expressly decreed that nothing could outrace the speed of light and \nyet here were physicists insisting that, somehow, at the subatomic level, information could. \n(No one, incidentally, has ever explained how the particles achieve this feat. Scientists have \ndealt with this problem, according to the physicist Yakir Aharanov, \u201cby not thinking about \nit.\u201d) \n    Above all, there was the problem that quantum physics introduced a level of untidiness that \nhadn\u2019t previously existed. Suddenly you needed two sets of laws to explain the behavior of \nthe universe\u2014quantum theory for the world of the very small and relativity for the larger \nuniverse beyond. The gravity of relativity theory was brilliant at explaining why planets \norbited suns or why galaxies tended to cluster, but turned out to have no influence at all at the \nparticle level. To explain what kept atoms together, other forces were needed, and in the \n1930s two were discovered: the strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force. The strong force \nbinds atoms together; it\u2019s what allows protons to bed down together in the nucleus. The weak \nforce engages in more miscellaneous tasks, mostly to do with controlling the rates of certain \nsorts of radioactive decay. \n    The weak nuclear force, despite its name, is ten billion billion billion times stronger than \ngravity, and the strong nuclear force is more powerful still\u2014vastly so, in fact\u2014but their \ninfluence extends to only the tiniest distances. The grip of the strong force reaches out only to \nabout 1/100,000 of the diameter of an atom. That\u2019s why the nuclei of atoms are so compacted \nand dense and why elements with big, crowded nuclei tend to be so unstable: the strong force \njust can\u2019t hold on to all the protons. \n    The upshot of all this is that physics ended up with two bodies of laws\u2014one for the world \nof the very small, one for the universe at large\u2014leading quite separate lives. Einstein disliked \nthat, too. He devoted the rest of his life to searching for a way to tie up these loose ends by \nfinding a grand unified theory, and always failed. From time to time he thought he had it, but \nit always unraveled on him in the end. As time passed he became increasingly marginalized \nand even a little pitied. Almost without exception, wrote Snow, \u201chis colleagues thought, and \nstill think, that he wasted the second half of his life.\u201d \n                                                 \n4 Or at least that is how it is nearly always rendered. The actual quote was: \u201cIt seems hard to sneak a look at \nGod\u2019s cards. But that He plays dice and uses \u2018telepathic\u2019 methods. . . is something that I cannot believe for a  \nsingle moment.\u201dElsewhere, however, real progress was being made. By the mid-1940s scientists had \nreached a point where they understood the atom at an extremely profound level\u2014as they all \ntoo effectively demonstrated in August 1945 by exploding a pair of atomic bombs over Japan. \n    By this point physicists could be excused for thinking that they had just about conquered \nthe atom. In fact, everything in particle physics was about to get a whole lot more \ncomplicated. But before we take up that slightly exhausting story, we must bring another \nstraw of our history up to date by considering an important and salutary tale of avarice, deceit, \nbad science, several needless deaths, and the final determination of the age of the Earth.", "10": "10    GETTING THE LEAD OUT \n \n \n \nIN THE LATE 1940s, a graduate student at the University of Chicago named Clair Patterson \n(who was, first name notwithstanding, an Iowa farm boy by origin) was using a new method \nof lead isotope measurement to try to get a definitive age for the Earth at last. Unfortunately \nall his samples came up contaminated\u2014usually wildly so. Most contained something like two \nhundred times the levels of lead that would normally be expected to occur. Many years would \npass before Patterson realized that the reason for this lay with a regrettable Ohio inventor \nnamed Thomas Midgley, Jr. \n    Midgley was an engineer by training, and the world would no doubt have been a safer place \nif he had stayed so. Instead, he developed an interest in the industrial applications of \nchemistry. In 1921, while working for the General Motors Research Corporation in Dayton, \nOhio, he investigated a compound called tetraethyl lead (also known, confusingly, as lead \ntetraethyl), and discovered that it significantly reduced the juddering condition known as \nengine knock. \n    Even though lead was widely known to be dangerous, by the early years of the twentieth \ncentury it could be found in all manner of consumer products. Food came in cans sealed with \nlead solder. Water was often stored in lead-lined tanks. It was sprayed onto fruit as a pesticide \nin the form of lead arsenate. It even came as part of the packaging of toothpaste tubes. Hardly \na product existed that didn\u2019t bring a little lead into consumers\u2019 lives. However, nothing gave it \na greater and more lasting intimacy than its addition to gasoline. \n    Lead is a neurotoxin. Get too much of it and you can irreparably damage the brain and \ncentral nervous system. Among the many symptoms associated with overexposure are \nblindness, insomnia, kidney failure, hearing loss, cancer, palsies, and convulsions. In its most \nacute form it produces abrupt and terrifying hallucinations, disturbing to victims and \nonlookers alike, which generally then give way to coma and death. You really don\u2019t want to \nget too much lead into your system. \n    On the other hand, lead was easy to extract and work, and almost embarrassingly profitable \nto produce industrially\u2014and tetraethyl lead did indubitably stop engines from knocking. So in \n1923 three of America\u2019s largest corporations, General Motors, Du Pont, and Standard Oil of \nNew Jersey, formed a joint enterprise called the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation (later shortened \nto simply Ethyl Corporation) with a view to making as much tetraethyl lead as the world was \nwilling to buy, and that proved to be a very great deal. They called their additive \u201cethyl\u201d \nbecause it sounded friendlier and less toxic than \u201clead\u201d and introduced it for public \nconsumption (in more ways than most people realized) on February 1, 1923. \n    Almost at once production workers began to exhibit the staggered gait and confused \nfaculties that mark the recently poisoned. Also almost at once, the Ethyl Corporation \nembarked on a policy of calm but unyielding denial that would serve it well for decades. As \nSharon Bertsch McGrayne notes in her absorbing history of industrial chemistry, \nPrometheans in the Lab, when employees at one plant developed irreversible delusions, aspokesman blandly informed reporters: \u201cThese men probably went insane because they \nworked too hard.\u201d Altogether at least fifteen workers died in the early days of production of \nleaded gasoline, and untold numbers of others became ill, often violently so; the exact \nnumbers are unknown because the company nearly always managed to hush up news of \nembarrassing leakages, spills, and poisonings. At times, however, suppressing the news \nbecame impossible, most notably in 1924 when in a matter of days five production workers \ndied and thirty-five more were turned into permanent staggering wrecks at a single ill-\nventilated facility. \n    As rumors circulated about the dangers of the new product, ethyl\u2019s ebullient inventor, \nThomas Midgley, decided to hold a demonstration for reporters to allay their concerns. As he \nchatted away about the company\u2019s commitment to safety, he poured tetraethyl lead over his \nhands, then held a beaker of it to his nose for sixty seconds, claiming all the while that he \ncould repeat the procedure daily without harm. In fact, Midgley knew only too well the perils \nof lead poisoning: he had himself been made seriously ill from overexposure a few months \nearlier and now, except when reassuring journalists, never went near the stuff if he could help \nit. \n  \n    Buoyed by the success of leaded gasoline, Midgley now turned to another technological \nproblem of the age. Refrigerators in the 1920s were often appallingly risky because they used \ndangerous gases that sometimes leaked. One leak from a refrigerator at a hospital in \nCleveland, Ohio, in 1929 killed more than a hundred people. Midgley set out to create a gas \nthat was stable, nonflammable, noncorrosive, and safe to breathe. With an instinct for the \nregrettable that was almost uncanny, he invented chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. \n    Seldom has an industrial product been more swiftly or unfortunately embraced. CFCs went \ninto production in the early 1930s and found a thousand applications in everything from car \nair conditioners to deodorant sprays before it was noticed, half a century later, that they were \ndevouring the ozone in the stratosphere. As you will be aware, this was not a good thing. \n    Ozone is a form of oxygen in which each molecule bears three atoms of oxygen instead of \ntwo. It is a bit of a chemical oddity in that at ground level it is a pollutant, while way up in the \nstratosphere it is beneficial, since it soaks up dangerous ultraviolet radiation. Beneficial ozone \nis not terribly abundant, however. If it were distributed evenly throughout the stratosphere, it \nwould form a layer just one eighth of an inch or so thick. That is why it is so easily disturbed, \nand why such disturbances don\u2019t take long to become critical. \n    Chlorofluorocarbons are also not very abundant\u2014they constitute only about one part per \nbillion of the atmosphere as a whole\u2014but they are extravagantly destructive. One pound of \nCFCs can capture and annihilate seventy thousand pounds of atmospheric ozone. CFCs also \nhang around for a long time\u2014about a century on average\u2014wreaking havoc all the while. \nThey are also great heat sponges. A single CFC molecule is about ten thousand times more \nefficient at exacerbating greenhouse effects than a molecule of carbon dioxide\u2014and carbon \ndioxide is of course no slouch itself as a greenhouse gas. In short, chlorofluorocarbons may \nultimately prove to be just about the worst invention of the twentieth century. \n    Midgley never knew this because he died long before anyone realized how destructive \nCFCs were. His death was itself memorably unusual. After becoming crippled with polio, \nMidgley invented a contraption involving a series of motorized pulleys that automaticallyraised or turned him in bed. In 1944, he became entangled in the cords as the machine went \ninto action and was strangled. \n  \n    If you were interested in finding out the ages of things, the University of Chicago in the \n1940s was the place to be. Willard Libby was in the process of inventing radiocarbon dating, \nallowing scientists to get an accurate reading of the age of bones and other organic remains, \nsomething they had never been able to do before. Up to this time, the oldest reliable dates \nwent back no further than the First Dynasty in Egypt from about 3000B.C. No one could \nconfidently say, for instance, when the last ice sheets had retreated or at what time in the past \nthe Cro-Magnon people had decorated the caves of Lascaux in France. \n    Libby\u2019s idea was so useful that he would be awarded a Nobel Prize for it in 1960. It was \nbased on the realization that all living things have within them an isotope of carbon called \ncarbon-14, which begins to decay at a measurable rate the instant they die. Carbon-14 has a \nhalf-life\u2014that is, the time it takes for half of any sample to disappear1\u2014of about 5,600 years, \nso by working out how much a given sample of carbon had decayed, Libby could get a good \nfix on the age of an object\u2014though only up to a point. After eight half-lives, only 1/256 of the \noriginal radioactive carbon remains, which is too little to make a reliable measurement, so \nradiocarbon dating works only for objects up to forty thousand or so years old. \n    Curiously, just as the technique was becoming widespread, certain flaws within it became \napparent. To begin with, it was discovered that one of the basic components of Libby\u2019s \nformula, known as the decay constant, was off by about 3 percent. By this time, however, \nthousands of measurements had been taken throughout the world. Rather than restate every \none, scientists decided to keep the inaccurate constant. \u201cThus,\u201d Tim Flannery notes, \u201cevery \nraw radiocarbon date you read today is given as too young by around 3 percent.\u201d The \nproblems didn\u2019t quite stop there. It was also quickly discovered that carbon-14 samples can be \neasily contaminated with carbon from other sources\u2014a tiny scrap of vegetable matter, for \ninstance, that has been collected with the sample and not noticed. For younger samples\u2014\nthose under twenty thousand years or so\u2014slight contamination does not always matter so \nmuch, but for older samples it can be a serious problem because so few remaining atoms are \nbeing counted. In the first instance, to borrow from Flannery, it is like miscounting by a dollar \nwhen counting to a thousand; in the second it is more like miscounting by a dollar when you \nhave only two dollars to count. \n    Libby\u2019s method was also based on the assumption that the amount of carbon-14 in the \natmosphere, and the rate at which it has been absorbed by living things, has been consistent \nthroughout history. In fact it hasn\u2019t been. We now know that the volume of atmospheric \ncarbon-14 varies depending on how well or not Earth\u2019s magnetism is deflecting cosmic rays, \nand that that can vary significantly over time. This means that some carbon-14 dates are more \n                                                 \n1 If you have ever wondered how the atoms determine which 50 percent will die and which 50 percent will \nsurvive for the next session, the answer is that the half-life is really just a statistical convenience-a kind of \nactuarial table for elemental things. Imagine you had a sample of material with a half-life of 30 seconds. It isn't \nthat every atom in the sample will exist for exactly 30 seconds or 60 seconds or 90 seconds or some other tidily \nordained period. Each atom will in fact survive for an entirely random length of time that has nothing to do with \nmultiples of 30; it might last until two seconds from now or it might oscillate away for years or decades or \ncenturies to come. No one can say. But what we can say is that for the sample as a whole the rate of \ndisappearance will be such that half the atoms will disappear every 30 seconds. It's an average rate, in other \nwords, and you can apply it to any large sampling. Someone once worked out, for instance, that dimes have a \nhalf-life of about 30 years.dubious than others. This is particularly so with dates just around the time that people first \ncame to the Americas, which is one of the reasons the matter is so perennially in dispute. \n    Finally, and perhaps a little unexpectedly, readings can be thrown out by seemingly \nunrelated external factors\u2014such as the diets of those whose bones are being tested. One \nrecent case involved the long-running debate over whether syphilis originated in the New \nWorld or the Old. Archeologists in Hull, in the north of England, found that monks in a \nmonastery graveyard had suffered from syphilis, but the initial conclusion that the monks had \ndone so before Columbus\u2019s voyage was cast into doubt by the realization that they had eaten a \nlot of fish, which could make their bones appear to be older than in fact they were. The monks \nmay well have had syphilis, but how it got to them, and when, remain tantalizingly \nunresolved. \n    Because of the accumulated shortcomings of carbon-14, scientists devised other methods of \ndating ancient materials, among them thermoluminesence, which measures electrons trapped \nin clays, and electron spin resonance, which involves bombarding a sample with \nelectromagnetic waves and measuring the vibrations of the electrons. But even the best of \nthese could not date anything older than about 200,000 years, and they couldn\u2019t date inorganic \nmaterials like rocks at all, which is of course what you need if you wish to determine the age \nof your planet. \n    The problems of dating rocks were such that at one point almost everyone in the world had \ngiven up on them. Had it not been for a determined English professor named Arthur Holmes, \nthe quest might well have fallen into abeyance altogether. \n    Holmes was heroic as much for the obstacles he overcame as for the results he achieved. \nBy the 1920s, when Holmes was in the prime of his career, geology had slipped out of \nfashion\u2014physics was the new excitement of the age\u2014and had become severely underfunded, \nparticularly in Britain, its spiritual birthplace. At Durham University, Holmes was for many \nyears the entire geology department. Often he had to borrow or patch together equipment in \norder to pursue his radiometric dating of rocks. At one point, his calculations were effectively \nheld up for a year while he waited for the university to provide him with a simple adding \nmachine. Occasionally, he had to drop out of academic life altogether to earn enough to \nsupport his family\u2014for a time he ran a curio shop in Newcastle upon Tyne\u2014and sometimes \nhe could not even afford the \u00a35 annual membership fee for the Geological Society. \n    The technique Holmes used in his work was theoretically straightforward and arose directly \nfrom the process, first observed by Ernest Rutherford in 1904, in which some atoms decay \nfrom one element into another at a rate predictable enough that you can use them as clocks. If \nyou know how long it takes for potassium-40 to become argon-40, and you measure the \namounts of each in a sample, you can work out how old a material is. Holmes\u2019s contribution \nwas to measure the decay rate of uranium into lead to calculate the age of rocks, and thus\u2014he \nhoped\u2014of the Earth. \n    But there were many technical difficulties to overcome. Holmes also needed\u2014or at least \nwould very much have appreciated\u2014sophisticated gadgetry of a sort that could make very \nfine measurements from tiny samples, and as we have seen it was all he could do to get a \nsimple adding machine. So it was quite an achievement when in 1946 he was able to \nannounce with some confidence that the Earth was at least three billion years old and possibly \nrather more. Unfortunately, he now met yet another formidable impediment to acceptance: the \nconservativeness of his fellow scientists. Although happy to praise his methodology, manymaintained that he had found not the age of the Earth but merely the age of the materials from \nwhich the Earth had been formed. \n    It was just at this time that Harrison Brown of the University of Chicago developed a new \nmethod for counting lead isotopes in igneous rocks (which is to say those that were created \nthrough heating, as opposed to the laying down of sediments). Realizing that the work would \nbe exceedingly tedious, he assigned it to young Clair Patterson as his dissertation project. \nFamously he promised Patterson that determining the age of the Earth with his new method \nwould be \u201cduck soup.\u201d In fact, it would take years. \n    Patterson began work on the project in 1948. Compared with Thomas Midgley\u2019s colorful \ncontributions to the march of progress, Patterson\u2019s discovery of the age of the Earth feels \nmore than a touch anticlimactic. For seven years, first at the University of Chicago and then at \nthe California Institute of Technology (where he moved in 1952), he worked in a sterile lab, \nmaking very precise measurements of the lead/uranium ratios in carefully selected samples of \nold rock. \n    The problem with measuring the age of the Earth was that you needed rocks that were \nextremely ancient, containing lead- and uranium-bearing crystals that were about as old as the \nplanet itself\u2014anything much younger would obviously give you misleadingly youthful \ndates\u2014but really ancient rocks are only rarely found on Earth. In the late 1940s no one \naltogether understood why this should be. Indeed, and rather extraordinarily, we would be \nwell into the space age before anyone could plausibly account for where all the Earth\u2019s old \nrocks went. (The answer was plate tectonics, which we shall of course get to.) Patterson, \nmeantime, was left to try to make sense of things with very limited materials. Eventually, and \ningeniously, it occurred to him that he could circumvent the rock shortage by using rocks \nfrom beyond Earth. He turned to meteorites. \n    The assumption he made\u2014rather a large one, but correct as it turned out\u2014was that many \nmeteorites are essentially leftover building materials from the early days of the solar system, \nand thus have managed to preserve a more or less pristine interior chemistry. Measure the age \nof these wandering rocks and you would have the age also (near enough) of the Earth. \n    As always, however, nothing was quite as straightforward as such a breezy description \nmakes it sound. Meteorites are not abundant and meteoritic samples not especially easy to get \nhold of. Moreover, Brown\u2019s measurement technique proved finicky in the extreme and \nneeded much refinement. Above all, there was the problem that Patterson\u2019s samples were \ncontinuously and unaccountably contaminated with large doses of atmospheric lead whenever \nthey were exposed to air. It was this that eventually led him to create a sterile laboratory\u2014the \nworld\u2019s first, according to at least one account. \n    It took Patterson seven years of patient work just to assemble suitable samples for final \ntesting. In the spring of 1953 he traveled to the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, \nwhere he was granted time on a late-model mass spectrograph, a machine capable of detecting \nand measuring the minute quantities of uranium and lead locked up in ancient crystals. When \nat last he had his results, Patterson was so excited that he drove straight to his boyhood home \nin Iowa and had his mother check him into a hospital because he thought he was having a \nheart attack. \n    Soon afterward, at a meeting in Wisconsin, Patterson announced a definitive age for the \nEarth of 4,550 million years (plus or minus 70 million years)\u2014\u201ca figure that standsunchanged 50 years later,\u201d as McGrayne admiringly notes. After two hundred years of trying, \nthe Earth finally had an age. \n  \n    His main work done, Patterson now turned his attention to the nagging question of all that \nlead in the atmosphere. He was astounded to find that what little was known about the effects \nof lead on humans was almost invariably wrong or misleading\u2014and not surprisingly, he \ndiscovered, since for forty years every study of lead\u2019s effects had been funded exclusively by \nmanufacturers of lead additives. \n    In one such study, a doctor who had no specialized training in chemical pathology \nundertook a five-year program in which volunteers were asked to breathe in or swallow lead \nin elevated quantities. Then their urine and feces were tested. Unfortunately, as the doctor \nappears not to have known, lead is not excreted as a waste product. Rather, it accumulates in \nthe bones and blood\u2014that\u2019s what makes it so dangerous\u2014and neither bone nor blood was \ntested. In consequence, lead was given a clean bill of health. \n    Patterson quickly established that we had a lot of lead in the atmosphere\u2014still do, in fact, \nsince lead never goes away\u2014and that about 90 percent of it appeared to come from \nautomobile exhaust pipes, but he couldn\u2019t prove it. What he needed was a way to compare \nlead levels in the atmosphere now with the levels that existed before 1923, when tetraethyl \nlead was introduced. It occurred to him that ice cores could provide the answer. \n    It was known that snowfall in places like Greenland accumulates into discrete annual layers \n(because seasonal temperature differences produce slight changes in coloration from winter to \nsummer). By counting back through these layers and measuring the amount of lead in each, he \ncould work out global lead concentrations at any time for hundreds, or even thousands, of \nyears. The notion became the foundation of ice core studies, on which much modern \nclimatological work is based. \n    What Patterson found was that before 1923 there was almost no lead in the atmosphere, and \nthat since that time its level had climbed steadily and dangerously. He now made it his life\u2019s \nquest to get lead taken out of gasoline. To that end, he became a constant and often vocal \ncritic of the lead industry and its interests. \n    It would prove to be a hellish campaign. Ethyl was a powerful global corporation with \nmany friends in high places. (Among its directors have been Supreme Court Justice Lewis \nPowell and Gilbert Grosvenor of the National Geographic Society.) Patterson suddenly found \nresearch funding withdrawn or difficult to acquire. The American Petroleum Institute \ncanceled a research contract with him, as did the United States Public Health Service, a \nsupposedly neutral government institution. \n    As Patterson increasingly became a liability to his institution, the school trustees were \nrepeatedly pressed by lead industry officials to shut him up or let him go. According to Jamie \nLincoln Kitman, writing in The Nation in 2000, Ethyl executives allegedly offered to endow a \nchair at Caltech \u201cif Patterson was sent packing.\u201d Absurdly, he was excluded from a 1971 \nNational Research Council panel appointed to investigate the dangers of atmospheric lead \npoisoning even though he was by now unquestionably the leading expert on atmospheric lead.To his great credit, Patterson never wavered or buckled. Eventually his efforts led to the \nintroduction of the Clean Air Act of 1970 and finally to the removal from sale of all leaded \ngasoline in the United States in 1986. Almost immediately lead levels in the blood of \nAmericans fell by 80 percent. But because lead is forever, those of us alive today have about \n625 times more lead in our blood than people did a century ago. The amount of lead in the \natmosphere also continues to grow, quite legally, by about a hundred thousand metric tons a \nyear, mostly from mining, smelting, and industrial activities. The United States also banned \nlead in indoor paint, \u201cforty-four years after most of Europe,\u201d as McGrayne notes. \nRemarkably, considering its startling toxicity, lead solder was not removed from American \nfood containers until 1993. \n    As for the Ethyl Corporation, it\u2019s still going strong, though GM, Standard Oil, and Du Pont \nno longer have stakes in the company. (They sold out to a company called Albemarle Paper in \n1962.) According to McGrayne, as late as February 2001 Ethyl continued to contend \u201cthat \nresearch has failed to show that leaded gasoline poses a threat to human health or the \nenvironment.\u201d On its website, a history of the company makes no mention of lead\u2014or indeed \nof Thomas Midgley\u2014but simply refers to the original product as containing \u201ca certain \ncombination of chemicals.\u201d \n    Ethyl no longer makes leaded gasoline, although, according to its 2001 company accounts, \ntetraethyl lead (or TEL as it calls it) still accounted for $25.1 million in sales in 2000 (out of \noverall sales of $795 million), up from $24.1 million in 1999, but down from $117 million in \n1998. In its report the company stated its determination to \u201cmaximize the cash generated by \nTEL as its usage continues to phase down around the world.\u201d Ethyl markets TEL through an \nagreement with Associated Octel of England. \n    As for the other scourge left to us by Thomas Midgley, chlorofluorocarbons, they were \nbanned in 1974 in the United States, but they are tenacious little devils and any that you \nloosed into the atmosphere before then (in your deodorants or hair sprays, for instance) will \nalmost certainly be around and devouring ozone long after you have shuffled off. Worse, we \nare still introducing huge amounts of CFCs into the atmosphere every year. According to \nWayne Biddle, 60 million pounds of the stuff, worth $1.5 billion, still finds its way onto the \nmarket every year. So who is making it? We are\u2014that is to say, many of our large \ncorporations are still making it at their plants overseas. It will not be banned in Third World \ncountries until 2010. \n    Clair Patterson died in 1995. He didn\u2019t win a Nobel Prize for his work. Geologists never \ndo. Nor, more puzzlingly, did he gain any fame or even much attention from half a century of \nconsistent and increasingly selfless achievement. A good case could be made that he was the \nmost influential geologist of the twentieth century. Yet who has ever heard of Clair Patterson? \nMost geology textbooks don\u2019t mention him. Two recent popular books on the history of the \ndating of Earth actually manage to misspell his name. In early 2001, a reviewer of one of \nthese books in the journal Nature made the additional, rather astounding error of thinking \nPatterson was a woman. \n    At all events, thanks to the work of Clair Patterson by 1953 the Earth at last had an age \neveryone could agree on. The only problem now was it was older than the universe that \ncontained it.", "11": "11    MUSTER MARK\u2019S QUARKS \n \n \n \nIN 1911, A British scientist named C. T. R. Wilson was studying cloud formations by \ntramping regularly to the summit of Ben Nevis, a famously damp Scottish mountain, when it \noccurred to him that there must be an easier way to study clouds. Back in the Cavendish Lab \nin Cambridge he built an artificial cloud chamber\u2014a simple device in which he could cool \nand moisten the air, creating a reasonable model of a cloud in laboratory conditions. \n    The device worked very well, but had an additional, unexpected benefit. When he \naccelerated an alpha particle through the chamber to seed his make-believe clouds, it left a \nvisible trail\u2014like the contrails of a passing airliner. He had just invented the particle detector. \nIt provided convincing evidence that subatomic particles did indeed exist. \n    Eventually two other Cavendish scientists invented a more powerful proton-beam device, \nwhile in California Ernest Lawrence at Berkeley produced his famous and impressive \ncyclotron, or atom smasher, as such devices were long excitingly known. All of these \ncontraptions worked\u2014and indeed still work\u2014on more or less the same principle, the idea \nbeing to accelerate a proton or other charged particle to an extremely high speed along a track \n(sometimes circular, sometimes linear), then bang it into another particle and see what flies \noff. That\u2019s why they were called atom smashers. It wasn\u2019t science at its subtlest, but it was \ngenerally effective. \n    As physicists built bigger and more ambitious machines, they began to find or postulate \nparticles or particle families seemingly without number: muons, pions, hyperons, mesons, K-\nmesons, Higgs bosons, intermediate vector bosons, baryons, tachyons. Even physicists began \nto grow a little uncomfortable. \u201cYoung man,\u201d Enrico Fermi replied when a student asked him \nthe name of a particular particle, \u201cif I could remember the names of these particles, I would \nhave been a botanist.\u201d \n    Today accelerators have names that sound like something Flash Gordon would use in \nbattle: the Super Proton Synchrotron, the Large Electron-Positron Collider, the Large Hadron \nCollider, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Using huge amounts of energy (some operate \nonly at night so that people in neighboring towns don\u2019t have to witness their lights fading \nwhen the apparatus is fired up), they can whip particles into such a state of liveliness that a \nsingle electron can do forty-seven thousand laps around a four-mile tunnel in a second. Fears \nhave been raised that in their enthusiasm scientists might inadvertently create a black hole or \neven something called \u201cstrange quarks,\u201d which could, theoretically, interact with other \nsubatomic particles and propagate uncontrollably. If you are reading this, that hasn\u2019t \nhappened. \n    Finding particles takes a certain amount of concentration. They are not just tiny and swift \nbut also often tantalizingly evanescent. Particles can come into being and be gone again in as \nlittle as 0.000000000000000000000001 second (10-24). Even the most sluggish of unstable \nparticles hang around for no more than 0.0000001 second (10-7).Some particles are almost ludicrously slippery. Every second the Earth is visited by 10,000 \ntrillion trillion tiny, all but massless neutrinos (mostly shot out by the nuclear broilings of the \nSun), and virtually all of them pass right through the planet and everything that is on it, \nincluding you and me, as if it weren\u2019t there. To trap just a few of them, scientists need tanks \nholding up to 12.5 million gallons of heavy water (that is, water with a relative abundance of \ndeuterium in it) in underground chambers (old mines usually) where they can\u2019t be interfered \nwith by other types of radiation. \n    Very occasionally, a passing neutrino will bang into one of the atomic nuclei in the water \nand produce a little puff of energy. Scientists count the puffs and by such means take us very \nslightly closer to understanding the fundamental properties of the universe. In 1998, Japanese \nobservers reported that neutrinos do have mass, but not a great deal\u2014about one ten-millionth \nthat of an electron. \n    What it really takes to find particles these days is money and lots of it. There is a curious \ninverse relationship in modern physics between the tininess of the thing being sought and the \nscale of facilities required to do the searching. CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear \nResearch, is like a little city. Straddling the border of France and Switzerland, it employs \nthree thousand people and occupies a site that is measured in square miles. CERN boasts a \nstring of magnets that weigh more than the Eiffel Tower and an underground tunnel over \nsixteen miles around. \n    Breaking up atoms, as James Trefil has noted, is easy; you do it each time you switch on a \nfluorescent light. Breaking up atomic nuclei, however, requires quite a lot of money and a \ngenerous supply of electricity. Getting down to the level of quarks\u2014the particles that make up \nparticles\u2014requires still more: trillions of volts of electricity and the budget of a small Central \nAmerican nation. CERN\u2019s new Large Hadron Collider, scheduled to begin operations in 2005, \nwill achieve fourteen trillion volts of energy and cost something over $1.5 billion to \nconstruct.1  \n    But these numbers are as nothing compared with what could have been achieved by, and \nspent upon, the vast and now unfortunately never-to-be Superconducting Supercollider, which \nbegan being constructed near Waxahachie, Texas, in the 1980s, before experiencing a \nsupercollision of its own with the United States Congress. The intention of the collider was to \nlet scientists probe \u201cthe ultimate nature of matter,\u201d as it is always put, by re-creating as nearly \nas possible the conditions in the universe during its first ten thousand billionths of a second. \nThe plan was to fling particles through a tunnel fifty-two miles long, achieving a truly \nstaggering ninety-nine trillion volts of energy. It was a grand scheme, but would also have \ncost $8 billion to build (a figure that eventually rose to $10 billion) and hundreds of millions \nof dollars a year to run. \n    In perhaps the finest example in history of pouring money into a hole in the ground, \nCongress spent $2 billion on the project, then canceled it in 1993 after fourteen miles of \ntunnel had been dug. So Texas now boasts the most expensive hole in the universe. The site \nis, I am told by my friend Jeff Guinn of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, \u201cessentially a vast, \ncleared field dotted along the circumference by a series of disappointed small towns.\u201d \n                                                 \n1 There are practical side effects to all this costly effort. The World Wide Web is a CERN offshoot. It was \ninvented by a CERN scientist, Tim Berners-Lee, in 1989.Since the supercollider debacle particle physicists have set their sights a little lower, but \neven comparatively modest projects can be quite breathtakingly costly when compared with, \nwell, almost anything. A proposed neutrino observatory at the old Homestake Mine in Lead, \nSouth Dakota, would cost $500 million to build\u2014this in a mine that is already dug\u2014before \nyou even look at the annual running costs. There would also be $281 million of \u201cgeneral \nconversion costs.\u201d A particle accelerator at Fermilab in Illinois, meanwhile, cost $260 million \nmerely to refit. \n    Particle physics, in short, is a hugely expensive enterprise\u2014but it is a productive one. \nToday the particle count is well over 150, with a further 100 or so suspected, but \nunfortunately, in the words of Richard Feynman, \u201cit is very difficult to understand the \nrelationships of all these particles, and what nature wants them for, or what the connections \nare from one to another.\u201d Inevitably each time we manage to unlock a box, we find that there \nis another locked box inside. Some people think there are particles called tachyons, which can \ntravel faster than the speed of light. Others long to find gravitons\u2014the seat of gravity. At \nwhat point we reach the irreducible bottom is not easy to say. Carl Sagan in Cosmos raised the \npossibility that if you traveled downward into an electron, you might find that it contained a \nuniverse of its own, recalling all those science fiction stories of the fifties. \u201cWithin it, \norganized into the local equivalent of galaxies and smaller structures, are an immense number \nof other, much tinier elementary particles, which are themselves universes at the next level \nand so on forever\u2014an infinite downward regression, universes within universes, endlessly. \nAnd upward as well.\u201d \n    For most of us it is a world that surpasses understanding. To read even an elementary guide \nto particle physics nowadays you must now find your way through lexical thickets such as \nthis: \u201cThe charged pion and antipion decay respectively into a muon plus antineutrino and an \nantimuon plus neutrino with an average lifetime of 2.603 x 10-8seconds, the neutral pion \ndecays into two photons with an average lifetime of about 0.8 x 10-16seconds, and the muon \nand antimuon decay respectively into . . .\u201d And so it runs on\u2014and this from a book for the \ngeneral reader by one of the (normally) most lucid of interpreters, Steven Weinberg. \n  \n    In the 1960s, in an attempt to bring just a little simplicity to matters, the Caltech physicist \nMurray Gell-Mann invented a new class of particles, essentially, in the words of Steven \nWeinberg, \u201cto restore some economy to the multitude of hadrons\u201d\u2014a collective term used by \nphysicists for protons, neutrons, and other particles governed by the strong nuclear force. \nGell-Mann\u2019s theory was that all hadrons were made up of still smaller, even more \nfundamental particles. His colleague Richard Feynman wanted to call these new basic \nparticles partons, as in Dolly, but was overruled. Instead they became known as quarks. \n    Gell-Mann took the name from a line in Finnegans Wake: \u201cThree quarks for Muster \nMark!\u201d (Discriminating physicists rhyme the word with storks, not larks, even though the \nlatter is almost certainly the pronunciation Joyce had in mind.) The fundamental simplicity of \nquarks was not long lived. As they became better understood it was necessary to introduce \nsubdivisions. Although quarks are much too small to have color or taste or any other physical \ncharacteristics we would recognize, they became clumped into six categories\u2014up, down, \nstrange, charm, top, and bottom\u2014which physicists oddly refer to as their \u201cflavors,\u201d and these \nare further divided into the colors red, green, and blue. (One suspects that it was not altogether \ncoincidental that these terms were first applied in California during the age of psychedelia.)Eventually out of all this emerged what is called the Standard Model, which is essentially a \nsort of parts kit for the subatomic world. The Standard Model consists of six quarks, six \nleptons, five known bosons and a postulated sixth, the Higgs boson (named for a Scottish \nscientist, Peter Higgs), plus three of the four physical forces: the strong and weak nuclear \nforces and electromagnetism. \n    The arrangement essentially is that among the basic building blocks of matter are quarks; \nthese are held together by particles called gluons; and together quarks and gluons form \nprotons and neutrons, the stuff of the atom\u2019s nucleus. Leptons are the source of electrons and \nneutrinos. Quarks and leptons together are called fermions. Bosons (named for the Indian \nphysicist S. N. Bose) are particles that produce and carry forces, and include photons and \ngluons. The Higgs boson may or may not actually exist; it was invented simply as a way of \nendowing particles with mass. \n    It is all, as you can see, just a little unwieldy, but it is the simplest model that can explain \nall that happens in the world of particles. Most particle physicists feel, as Leon Lederman \nremarked in a 1985 PBS documentary, that the Standard Model lacks elegance and simplicity. \n\u201cIt is too complicated. It has too many arbitrary parameters,\u201d Lederman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really \nsee the creator twiddling twenty knobs to set twenty parameters to create the universe as we \nknow it.\u201d Physics is really nothing more than a search for ultimate simplicity, but so far all we \nhave is a kind of elegant messiness\u2014or as Lederman put it: \u201cThere is a deep feeling that the \npicture is not beautiful.\u201d \n    The Standard Model is not only ungainly but incomplete. For one thing, it has nothing at all \nto say about gravity. Search through the Standard Model as you will, and you won\u2019t find \nanything to explain why when you place a hat on a table it doesn\u2019t float up to the ceiling. Nor, \nas we\u2019ve just noted, can it explain mass. In order to give particles any mass at all we have to \nintroduce the notional Higgs boson; whether it actually exists is a matter for twenty-first-\ncentury physics. As Feynman cheerfully observed: \u201cSo we are stuck with a theory, and we do \nnot know whether it is right or wrong, but we do know that it is a little wrong, or at least \nincomplete.\u201d \n    In an attempt to draw everything together, physicists have come up with something called \nsuperstring theory. This postulates that all those little things like quarks and leptons that we \nhad previously thought of as particles are actually \u201cstrings\u201d\u2014vibrating strands of energy that \noscillate in eleven dimensions, consisting of the three we know already plus time and seven \nother dimensions that are, well, unknowable to us. The strings are very tiny\u2014tiny enough to \npass for point particles. \n    By introducing extra dimensions, superstring theory enables physicists to pull together \nquantum laws and gravitational ones into one comparatively tidy package, but it also means \nthat anything scientists say about the theory begins to sound worryingly like the sort of \nthoughts that would make you edge away if conveyed to you by a stranger on a park bench. \nHere, for example, is the physicist Michio Kaku explaining the structure of the universe from \na superstring perspective: \u201cThe heterotic string consists of a closed string that has two types of \nvibrations, clockwise and counterclockwise, which are treated differently. The clockwise \nvibrations live in a ten-dimensional space. The counterclockwise live in a twenty-six-\ndimensional space, of which sixteen dimensions have been compactified. (We recall that in \nKaluza\u2019s original five-dimensional, the fifth dimension was compactified by being wrapped \nup into a circle.)\u201d And so it goes, for some 350 pages.String theory has further spawned something called \u201cM theory,\u201d which incorporates \nsurfaces known as membranes\u2014or simply \u201cbranes\u201d to the hipper souls of the world of \nphysics. I\u2019m afraid this is the stop on the knowledge highway where most of us must get off. \nHere is a sentence from the New York Times, explaining this as simply as possible to a general \naudience: \u201cThe ekpyrotic process begins far in the indefinite past with a pair of flat empty \nbranes sitting parallel to each other in a warped five-dimensional space. . . . The two branes, \nwhich form the walls of the fifth dimension, could have popped out of nothingness as a \nquantum fluctuation in the even more distant past and then drifted apart.\u201d No arguing with \nthat. No understanding it either. Ekpyrotic, incidentally, comes from the Greek word for \n\u201cconflagration.\u201d \n    Matters in physics have now reached such a pitch that, as Paul Davies noted in Nature, it is \n\u201calmost impossible for the non-scientist to discriminate between the legitimately weird and \nthe outright crackpot.\u201d The question came interestingly to a head in the fall of 2002 when two \nFrench physicists, twin brothers Igor and Grickha Bogdanov, produced a theory of ambitious \ndensity involving such concepts as \u201cimaginary time\u201d and the \u201cKubo-Schwinger-Martin \ncondition,\u201d and purporting to describe the nothingness that was the universe before the Big \nBang\u2014a period that was always assumed to be unknowable (since it predated the birth of \nphysics and its properties). \n    Almost at once the Bogdanov paper excited debate among physicists as to whether it was \ntwaddle, a work of genius, or a hoax. \u201cScientifically, it\u2019s clearly more or less complete \nnonsense,\u201d Columbia University physicist Peter Woit told the New York Times, \u201cbut these \ndays that doesn\u2019t much distinguish it from a lot of the rest of the literature.\u201d \n    Karl Popper, whom Steven Weinberg has called \u201cthe dean of modern philosophers of \nscience,\u201d once suggested that there may not be an ultimate theory for physics\u2014that, rather, \nevery explanation may require a further explanation, producing \u201can infinite chain of more and \nmore fundamental principles.\u201d A rival possibility is that such knowledge may simply be \nbeyond us. \u201cSo far, fortunately,\u201d writes Weinberg in Dreams of a Final Theory, \u201cwe do not \nseem to be coming to the end of our intellectual resources.\u201d \n    Almost certainly this is an area that will see further developments of thought, and almost \ncertainly these thoughts will again be beyond most of us. \n  \n    While physicists in the middle decades of the twentieth-century were looking perplexedly \ninto the world of the very small, astronomers were finding no less arresting an incompleteness \nof understanding in the universe at large. \n    When we last met Edwin Hubble, he had determined that nearly all the galaxies in our field \nof view are flying away from us, and that the speed and distance of this retreat are neatly \nproportional: the farther away the galaxy, the faster it is moving. Hubble realized that this \ncould be expressed with a simple equation, Ho = v/d (where Ho is the constant, v is the \nrecessional velocity of a flying galaxy, andd its distance away from us). Ho has been known \never since as the Hubble constant and the whole as Hubble\u2019s Law. Using his formula, Hubble \ncalculated that the universe was about two billion years old, which was a little awkward \nbecause even by the late 1920s it was fairly obvious that many things within the universe\u2014\nnot least Earth itself\u2014were probably older than that. Refining this figure has been an ongoing \npreoccupation of cosmology.Almost the only thing constant about the Hubble constant has been the amount of \ndisagreement over what value to give it. In 1956, astronomers discovered that Cepheid \nvariables were more variable than they had thought; they came in two varieties, not one. This \nallowed them to rework their calculations and come up with a new age for the universe of \nfrom 7 to 20 billion years\u2014not terribly precise, but at least old enough, at last, to embrace the \nformation of the Earth. \n    In the years that followed there erupted a long-running dispute between Allan Sandage, heir \nto Hubble at Mount Wilson, and G\u00e9rard de Vaucouleurs, a French-born astronomer based at \nthe University of Texas. Sandage, after years of careful calculations, arrived at a value for the \nHubble constant of 50, giving the universe an age of 20 billion years. De Vaucouleurs was \nequally certain that the Hubble constant was 100.2 This would mean that the universe was \nonly half the size and age that Sandage believed\u2014ten billion years. Matters took a further \nlurch into uncertainty when in 1994 a team from the Carnegie Observatories in California, \nusing measures from the Hubble space telescope, suggested that the universe could be as little \nas eight billion years old\u2014an age even they conceded was younger than some of the stars \nwithin the universe. In February 2003, a team from NASA and the Goddard Space Flight \nCenter in Maryland, using a new, far-reaching type of satellite called the Wilkinson \nMicrowave Anistropy Probe, announced with some confidence that the age of the universe is \n13.7 billion years, give or take a hundred million years or so. There matters rest, at least for \nthe moment. \n    The difficulty in making final determinations is that there are often acres of room for \ninterpretation. Imagine standing in a field at night and trying to decide how far away two \ndistant electric lights are. Using fairly straightforward tools of astronomy you can easily \nenough determine that the bulbs are of equal brightness and that one is, say, 50 percent more \ndistant than the other. But what you can\u2019t be certain of is whether the nearer light is, let us \nsay, a 58-watt bulb that is 122 feet away or a 61-watt light that is 119 feet, 8 inches away. On \ntop of that you must make allowances for distortions caused by variations in the Earth\u2019s \natmosphere, by intergalactic dust, contaminating light from foreground stars, and many other \nfactors. The upshot is that your computations are necessarily based on a series of nested \nassumptions, any of which could be a source of contention. There is also the problem that \naccess to telescopes is always at a premium and historically measuring red shifts has been \nnotably costly in telescope time. It could take all night to get a single exposure. In \nconsequence, astronomers have sometimes been compelled (or willing) to base conclusions \non notably scanty evidence. In cosmology, as the journalist Geoffrey Carr has suggested, we \nhave \u201ca mountain of theory built on a molehill of evidence.\u201d Or as Martin Rees has put it: \n\u201cOur present satisfaction [with our state of understanding] may reflect the paucity of the data \nrather than the excellence of the theory.\u201d \n    This uncertainty applies, incidentally, to relatively nearby things as much as to the distant \nedges of the universe. As Donald Goldsmith notes, when astronomers say that the galaxy M87 \nis 60 million light-years away, what they really mean (\u201cbut do not often stress to the general \npublic\u201d) is that it is somewhere between 40 million and 90 million light-years away\u2014not \n                                                 \n2 You are of course entitled to wonder what is meant exactly by \"a constant of 50\" or \"a constant of 100.\" The \nanswer lies in astronomical units of measure. Except conversationally, astronomers don't use light-years. They \nuse a distance called the parsec (a contraction of parallax and second), based on a universal measure called the \nstellar parallax and equivalent to 3.26 light-years. Really big measures, like the size of a universe, are measured \nin megaparsecs: a million parsecs. The constant is expressed in terms of kilometers per second per megaparsec. \nThus when astronomers refer to a Hubble constant of 50, what they really mean is \"50 kilometers per second per \nmegaparsec.\" For most of us that is of course an utterly meaningless measure, but then with astronomical \nmeasures most distances are so huge as to be utterly meaningless.quite the same thing. For the universe at large, matters are naturally magnified. Bearing all \nthat in mind, the best bets these days for the age of the universe seem to be fixed on a range of \nabout 12 billion to 13.5 billion years, but we remain a long way from unanimity. \n    One interesting recently suggested theory is that the universe is not nearly as big as we \nthought, that when we peer into the distance some of the galaxies we see may simply be \nreflections, ghost images created by rebounded light. \n    The fact is, there is a great deal, even at quite a fundamental level, that we don\u2019t know\u2014not \nleast what the universe is made of. When scientists calculate the amount of matter needed to \nhold things together, they always come up desperately short. It appears that at least 90 percent \nof the universe, and perhaps as much as 99 percent, is composed of Fritz Zwicky\u2019s \u201cdark \nmatter\u201d\u2014stuff that is by its nature invisible to us. It is slightly galling to think that we live in \na universe that, for the most part, we can\u2019t even see, but there you are. At least the names for \nthe two main possible culprits are entertaining: they are said to be either WIMPs (for Weakly \nInteracting Massive Particles, which is to say specks of invisible matter left over from the Big \nBang) or MACHOs (for MAssive Compact Halo Objects\u2014really just another name for black \nholes, brown dwarfs, and other very dim stars). \n    Particle physicists have tended to favor the particle explanation of WIMPs, astrophysicists \nthe stellar explanation of MACHOs. For a time MACHOs had the upper hand, but not nearly \nenough of them were found, so sentiment swung back toward WIMPs but with the problem \nthat no WIMP has ever been found. Because they are weakly interacting, they are (assuming \nthey even exist) very hard to detect. Cosmic rays would cause too much interference. So \nscientists must go deep underground. One kilometer underground cosmic bombardments \nwould be one millionth what they would be on the surface. But even when all these are added \nin, \u201ctwo-thirds of the universe is still missing from the balance sheet,\u201d as one commentator \nhas put it. For the moment we might very well call them DUNNOS (for Dark Unknown \nNonreflective Nondetectable Objects Somewhere). \n    Recent evidence suggests that not only are the galaxies of the universe racing away from \nus, but that they are doing so at a rate that is accelerating. This is counter to all expectations. It \nappears that the universe may not only be filled with dark matter, but with dark energy. \nScientists sometimes also call it vacuum energy or, more exotically, quintessence. Whatever it \nis, it seems to be driving an expansion that no one can altogether account for. The theory is \nthat empty space isn\u2019t so empty at all\u2014that there are particles of matter and antimatter \npopping into existence and popping out again\u2014and that these are pushing the universe \noutward at an accelerating rate. Improbably enough, the one thing that resolves all this is \nEinstein\u2019s cosmological constant\u2014the little piece of math he dropped into the general theory \nof relativity to stop the universe\u2019s presumed expansion, and called \u201cthe biggest blunder of my \nlife.\u201d It now appears that he may have gotten things right after all. \n    The upshot of all this is that we live in a universe whose age we can\u2019t quite compute, \nsurrounded by stars whose distances we don\u2019t altogether know, filled with matter we can\u2019t \nidentify, operating in conformance with physical laws whose properties we don\u2019t truly \nunderstand. \n    And on that rather unsettling note, let\u2019s return to Planet Earth and consider something that \nwe do understand\u2014though by now you perhaps won\u2019t be surprised to hear that we don\u2019t \nunderstand it completely and what we do understand we haven\u2019t understood for long.", "12": "12    THE EARTH MOVES \n \n \n \n \nIN ONE OF his last professional acts before his death in 1955, Albert Einstein wrote a short \nbut glowing foreword to a book by a geologist named Charles Hapgood entitled Earth\u2019s \nShifting Crust: A Key to Some Basic Problems of Earth Science. Hapgood\u2019s book was a \nsteady demolition of the idea that continents were in motion. In a tone that all but invited the \nreader to join him in a tolerant chuckle, Hapgood observed that a few gullible souls had \nnoticed \u201can apparent correspondence in shape between certain continents.\u201d It would appear, \nhe went on, \u201cthat South America might be fitted together with Africa, and so on. . . . It is even \nclaimed that rock formations on opposite sides of the Atlantic match.\u201d \n    Mr. Hapgood briskly dismissed any such notions, noting that the geologists K. E. Caster \nand J. C. Mendes had done extensive fieldwork on both sides of the Atlantic and had \nestablished beyond question that no such similarities existed. Goodness knows what outcrops \nMessrs. Caster and Mendes had looked at, beacuse in fact many of the rock formations on \nboth sides of the Atlanticare the same\u2014not just very similar but the same. \n    This was not an idea that flew with Mr. Hapgood, or many other geologists of his day. The \ntheory Hapgood alluded to was one first propounded in 1908 by an amateur American \ngeologist named Frank Bursley Taylor. Taylor came from a wealthy family and had both the \nmeans and freedom from academic constraints to pursue unconventional lines of inquiry. He \nwas one of those struck by the similarity in shape between the facing coastlines of Africa and \nSouth America, and from this observation he developed the idea that the continents had once \nslid around. He suggested\u2014presciently as it turned out\u2014that the crunching together of \ncontinents could have thrust up the world\u2019s mountain chains. He failed, however, to produce \nmuch in the way of evidence, and the theory was considered too crackpot to merit serious \nattention. \n    In Germany, however, Taylor\u2019s idea was picked up, and effectively appropriated, by a \ntheorist named Alfred Wegener, a meteorologist at the University of Marburg. Wegener \ninvestigated the many plant and fossil anomalies that did not fit comfortably into the standard \nmodel of Earth history and realized that very little of it made sense if conventionally \ninterpreted. Animal fossils repeatedly turned up on opposite sides of oceans that were clearly \ntoo wide to swim. How, he wondered, did marsupials travel from South America to Australia? \nHow did identical snails turn up in Scandinavia and New England? And how, come to that, \ndid one account for coal seams and other semi-tropical remnants in frigid spots like \nSpitsbergen, four hundred miles north of Norway, if they had not somehow migrated there \nfrom warmer climes? \n    Wegener developed the theory that the world\u2019s continents had once come together in a \nsingle landmass he called Pangaea, where flora and fauna had been able to mingle, before the \ncontinents had split apart and floated off to their present positions. All this he put together in a \nbook called Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane, or The Origin of Continents andOceans, which was published in German in 1912 and\u2014despite the outbreak of the First \nWorld War in the meantime\u2014in English three years later. \n    Because of the war, Wegener\u2019s theory didn\u2019t attract much notice at first, but by 1920, when \nhe produced a revised and expanded edition, it quickly became a subject of discussion. \nEveryone agreed that continents moved\u2014but up and down, not sideways. The process of \nvertical movement, known as isostasy, was a foundation of geological beliefs for generations, \nthough no one had any good theories as to how or why it happened. One idea, which remained \nin textbooks well into my own school days, was the baked apple theory propounded by the \nAustrian Eduard Suess just before the turn of the century. This suggested that as the molten \nEarth had cooled, it had become wrinkled in the manner of a baked apple, creating ocean \nbasins and mountain ranges. Never mind that James Hutton had shown long before that any \nsuch static arrangement would eventually result in a featureless spheroid as erosion leveled \nthe bumps and filled in the divots. There was also the problem, demonstrated by Rutherford \nand Soddy early in the century, that Earthly elements hold huge reserves of heat\u2014much too \nmuch to allow for the sort of cooling and shrinking Suess suggested. And anyway, if Suess\u2019s \ntheory was correct then mountains should be evenly distributed across the face of the Earth, \nwhich patently they were not, and of more or less the same ages; yet by the early 1900s it was \nalready evident that some ranges, like the Urals and Appalachians, were hundreds of millions \nof years older than others, like the Alps and Rockies. Clearly the time was ripe for a new \ntheory. Unfortunately, Alfred Wegener was not the man that geologists wished to provide it. \n    For a start, his radical notions questioned the foundations of their discipline, seldom an \neffective way to generate warmth in an audience. Such a challenge would have been painful \nenough coming from a geologist, but Wegener had no background in geology. He was a \nmeteorologist, for goodness sake. A weatherman\u2014a German weatherman. These were not \nremediable deficiencies. \n    And so geologists took every pain they could think of to dismiss his evidence and belittle \nhis suggestions. To get around the problems of fossil distributions, they posited ancient \u201cland \nbridges\u201d wherever they were needed. When an ancient horse named Hipparion was found to \nhave lived in France and Florida at the same time, a land bridge was drawn across the \nAtlantic. When it was realized that ancient tapirs had existed simultaneously in South \nAmerica and Southeast Asia a land bridge was drawn there, too. Soon maps of prehistoric \nseas were almost solid with hypothesized land bridges\u2014from North America to Europe, from \nBrazil to Africa, from Southeast Asia to Australia, from Australia to Antarctica. These \nconnective tendrils had not only conveniently appeared whenever it was necessary to move a \nliving organism from one landmass to another, but then obligingly vanished without leaving a \ntrace of their former existence. None of this, of course, was supported by so much as a grain \nof actual evidence\u2014nothing so wrong could be\u2014yet it was geological orthodoxy for the next \nhalf century. \n    Even land bridges couldn\u2019t explain some things. One species of trilobite that was well \nknown in Europe was also found to have lived on Newfoundland\u2014but only on one side. No \none could persuasively explain how it had managed to cross two thousand miles of hostile \nocean but then failed to find its way around the corner of a 200-mile-wide island. Even more \nawkwardly anomalous was another species of trilobite found in Europe and the Pacific \nNorthwest but nowhere in between, which would have required not so much a land bridge as a \nflyover. Yet as late as 1964 when the Encyclopaedia Britannica discussed the rival theories, it \nwas Wegener\u2019s that was held to be full of \u201cnumerous grave theoretical difficulties.\u201dTo be sure, Wegener made mistakes. He asserted that Greenland is drifting west by about a \nmile a year, which is clearly nonsense. (It\u2019s more like half an inch.) Above all, he could offer \nno convincing explanation for how the landmasses moved about. To believe in his theory you \nhad to accept that massive continents somehow pushed through solid crust, like a plow \nthrough soil, without leaving any furrow in their wake. Nothing then known could plausibly \nexplain what motored these massive movements. \n    It was Arthur Holmes, the English geologist who did so much to determine the age of the \nEarth, who suggested a possible way. Holmes was the first scientist to understand that \nradioactive warming could produce convection currents within the Earth. In theory these \ncould be powerful enough to slide continents around on the surface. In his popular and \ninfluential textbook Principles of Physical Geology , first published in 1944, Holmes laid out \na continental drift theory that was in its fundamentals the theory that prevails today. It was \nstill a radical proposition for the time and widely criticized, particularly in the United States, \nwhere resistance to drift lasted longer than elsewhere. One reviewer there fretted, without any \nevident sense of irony, that Holmes presented his arguments so clearly and compellingly that \nstudents might actually come to believe them. \n    Elsewhere, however, the new theory drew steady if cautious support. In 1950, a vote at the \nannual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science showed that about \nhalf of those present now embraced the idea of continental drift. (Hapgood soon after cited \nthis figure as proof of how tragically misled British geologists had become.) Curiously, \nHolmes himself sometimes wavered in his conviction. In 1953 he confessed: \u201cI have never \nsucceeded in freeing myself from a nagging prejudice against continental drift; in my \ngeological bones, so to speak, I feel the hypothesis is a fantastic one.\u201d \n    Continental drift was not entirely without support in the United States. Reginald Daly of \nHarvard spoke for it, but he, you may recall, was the man who suggested that the Moon had \nbeen formed by a cosmic impact, and his ideas tended to be considered interesting, even \nworthy, but a touch too exuberant for serious consideration. And so most American academics \nstuck to the belief that the continents had occupied their present positions forever and that \ntheir surface features could be attributed to something other than lateral motions. \n    Interestingly, oil company geologists had known for years that if you wanted to find oil you \nhad to allow for precisely the sort of surface movements that were implied by plate tectonics. \nBut oil geologists didn\u2019t write academic papers; they just found oil. \n  \n    There was one other major problem with Earth theories that no one had resolved, or even \ncome close to resolving. That was the question of where all the sediments went. Every year \nEarth\u2019s rivers carried massive volumes of eroded material\u2014500 million tons of calcium, for \ninstance\u2014to the seas. If you multiplied the rate of deposition by the number of years it had \nbeen going on, it produced a disturbing figure: there should be about twelve miles of \nsediments on the ocean bottoms\u2014or, put another way, the ocean bottoms should by now be \nwell above the ocean tops. Scientists dealt with this paradox in the handiest possible way. \nThey ignored it. But eventually there came a point when they could ignore it no longer. \n    In the Second World War, a Princeton University mineralogist named Harry Hess was put \nin charge of an attack transport ship, the USS Cape Johnson. Aboard this vessel was a fancy \nnew depth sounder called a fathometer, which was designed to facilitate inshore maneuversduring beach landings, but Hess realized that it could equally well be used for scientific \npurposes and never switched it off, even when far out at sea, even in the heat of battle. What \nhe found was entirely unexpected. If the ocean floors were ancient, as everyone assumed, they \nshould be thickly blanketed with sediments, like the mud on the bottom of a river or lake. But \nHess\u2019s readings showed that the ocean floor offered anything but the gooey smoothness of \nancient silts. It was scored everywhere with canyons, trenches, and crevasses and dotted with \nvolcanic seamounts that he called guyots after an earlier Princeton geologist named Arnold \nGuyot. All this was a puzzle, but Hess had a war to take part in, and put such thoughts to the \nback of his mind. \n    After the war, Hess returned to Princeton and the preoccupations of teaching, but the \nmysteries of the seafloor continued to occupy a space in his thoughts. Meanwhile, throughout \nthe 1950s oceanographers were undertaking more and more sophisticated surveys of the \nocean floors. In so doing, they found an even bigger surprise: the mightiest and most \nextensive mountain range on Earth was\u2014mostly\u2014underwater. It traced a continuous path \nalong the world\u2019s seabeds, rather like the stitching on a baseball. If you began at Iceland, you \ncould follow it down the center of the Atlantic Ocean, around the bottom of Africa, and across \nthe Indian and Southern Oceans, below Australia; there it angled across the Pacific as if \nmaking for Baja California before shooting up the west coast of the United States to Alaska. \nOccasionally its higher peaks poked above the water as an island or archipelago\u2014the Azores \nand Canaries in the Atlantic, Hawaii in the Pacific, for instance\u2014but mostly it was buried \nunder thousands of fathoms of salty sea, unknown and unsuspected. When all its branches \nwere added together, the network extended to 46,600 miles. \n    A very little of this had been known for some time. People laying ocean-floor cables in the \nnineteenth century had realized that there was some kind of mountainous intrusion in the mid-\nAtlantic from the way the cables ran, but the continuous nature and overall scale of the chain \nwas a stunning surprise. Moreover, it contained physical anomalies that couldn\u2019t be explained. \nDown the middle of the mid-Atlantic ridge was a canyon\u2014a rift\u2014up to a dozen miles wide \nfor its entire 12,000-mile length. This seemed to suggest that the Earth was splitting apart at \nthe seams, like a nut bursting out of its shell. It was an absurd and unnerving notion, but the \nevidence couldn\u2019t be denied. \n    Then in 1960 core samples showed that the ocean floor was quite young at the mid-Atlantic \nridge but grew progressively older as you moved away from it to the east or west. Harry Hess \nconsidered the matter and realized that this could mean only one thing: new ocean crust was \nbeing formed on either side of the central rift, then being pushed away from it as new crust \ncame along behind. The Atlantic floor was effectively two large conveyor belts, one carrying \ncrust toward North America, the other carrying crust toward Europe. The process became \nknown as seafloor spreading. \n    When the crust reached the end of its journey at the boundary with continents, it plunged \nback into the Earth in a process known as subduction. That explained where all the sediment \nwent. It was being returned to the bowels of the Earth. It also explained why ocean floors \neverywhere were so comparatively youthful. None had ever been found to be older than about \n175 million years, which was a puzzle because continental rocks were often billions of years \nold. Now Hess could see why. Ocean rocks lasted only as long as it took them to travel to \nshore. It was a beautiful theory that explained a great deal. Hess elaborated his ideas in an \nimportant paper, which was almost universally ignored. Sometimes the world just isn\u2019t ready \nfor a good idea.Meanwhile, two researchers, working independently, were making some startling findings \nby drawing on a curious fact of Earth history that had been discovered several decades earlier. \nIn 1906, a French physicist named Bernard Brunhes had found that the planet\u2019s magnetic field \nreverses itself from time to time, and that the record of these reversals is permanently fixed in \ncertain rocks at the time of their birth. Specifically, tiny grains of iron ore within the rocks \npoint to wherever the magnetic poles happen to be at the time of their formation, then stay \npointing in that direction as the rocks cool and harden. In effect they \u201cremember\u201d where the \nmagnetic poles were at the time of their creation. For years this was little more than a \ncuriosity, but in the 1950s Patrick Blackett of the University of London and S. K. Runcorn of \nthe University of Newcastle studied the ancient magnetic patterns frozen in British rocks and \nwere startled, to say the very least, to find them indicating that at some time in the distant past \nBritain had spun on its axis and traveled some distance to the north, as if it had somehow \ncome loose from its moorings. Moreover, they also discovered that if you placed a map of \nEurope\u2019s magnetic patterns alongside an American one from the same period, they fit together \nas neatly as two halves of a torn letter. It was uncanny. \n    Their findings were ignored too. \n    It finally fell to two men from Cambridge University, a geophysicist named Drummond \nMatthews and a graduate student of his named Fred Vine, to draw all the strands together. In \n1963, using magnetic studies of the Atlantic Ocean floor, they demonstrated conclusively that \nthe seafloors were spreading in precisely the manner Hess had suggested and that the \ncontinents were in motion too. An unlucky Canadian geologist named Lawrence Morley came \nup with the same conclusion at the same time, but couldn\u2019t find anyone to publish his paper. \nIn what has become a famous snub, the editor of the Journal of Geophysical Research told \nhim: \u201cSuch speculations make interesting talk at cocktail parties, but it is not the sort of thing \nthat ought to be published under serious scientific aegis.\u201d One geologist later described it as \n\u201cprobably the most significant paper in the earth sciences ever to be denied publication.\u201d \n    At all events, mobile crust was an idea whose time had finally come. A symposium of \nmany of the most important figures in the field was convened in London under the auspices of \nthe Royal Society in 1964, and suddenly, it seemed, everyone was a convert. The Earth, the \nmeeting agreed, was a mosaic of interconnected segments whose various stately jostlings \naccounted for much of the planet\u2019s surface behavior. \n    The name \u201ccontinental drift\u201d was fairly swiftly discarded when it was realized that the \nwhole crust was in motion and not just the continents, but it took a while to settle on a name \nfor the individual segments. At first people called them \u201ccrustal blocks\u201d or sometimes \u201cpaving \nstones.\u201d Not until late 1968, with the publication of an article by three American \nseismologists in the Journal of Geophysical Research , did the segments receive the name by \nwhich they have since been known: plates. The same article called the new science plate \ntectonics. \n    Old ideas die hard, and not everyone rushed to embrace the exciting new theory. Well into \nthe 1970s, one of the most popular and influential geological textbooks, The Earth by the \nvenerable Harold Jeffreys, strenuously insisted that plate tectonics was a physical \nimpossibility, just as it had in the first edition way back in 1924. It was equally dismissive of \nconvection and seafloor spreading. And in Basin and Range, published in 1980, John McPhee \nnoted that even then one American geologist in eight still didn\u2019t believe in plate tectonics.Today we know that Earth\u2019s surface is made up of eight to twelve big plates (depending on \nhow you define big) and twenty or so smaller ones, and they all move in different directions \nand at different speeds. Some plates are large and comparatively inactive, others small but \nenergetic. They bear only an incidental relationship to the landmasses that sit upon them. The \nNorth American plate, for instance, is much larger than the continent with which it is \nassociated. It roughly traces the outline of the continent\u2019s western coast (which is why that \narea is so seismically active, because of the bump and crush of the plate boundary), but \nignores the eastern seaboard altogether and instead extends halfway across the Atlantic to the \nmid-ocean ridge. Iceland is split down the middle, which makes it tectonically half American \nand half European. New Zealand, meanwhile, is part of the immense Indian Ocean plate even \nthough it is nowhere near the Indian Ocean. And so it goes for most plates. \n    The connections between modern landmasses and those of the past were found to be \ninfinitely more complex than anyone had imagined. Kazakhstan, it turns out, was once \nattached to Norway and New England. One corner of Staten Island, but only a corner, is \nEuropean. So is part of Newfoundland. Pick up a pebble from a Massachusetts beach, and its \nnearest kin will now be in Africa. The Scottish Highlands and much of Scandinavia are \nsubstantially American. Some of the Shackleton Range of Antarctica, it is thought, may once \nhave belonged to the Appalachians of the eastern U.S. Rocks, in short, get around. \n    The constant turmoil keeps the plates from fusing into a single immobile plate. Assuming \nthings continue much as at present, the Atlantic Ocean will expand until eventually it is much \nbigger than the Pacific. Much of California will float off and become a kind of Madagascar of \nthe Pacific. Africa will push northward into Europe, squeezing the Mediterranean out of \nexistence and thrusting up a chain of mountains of Himalayan majesty running from Paris to \nCalcutta. Australia will colonize the islands to its north and connect by some isthmian \numbilicus to Asia. These are future outcomes, but not future events. The events are happening \nnow. As we sit here, continents are adrift, like leaves on a pond. Thanks to Global Positioning \nSystems we can see that Europe and North America are parting at about the speed a fingernail \ngrows\u2014roughly two yards in a human lifetime. If you were prepared to wait long enough, \nyou could ride from Los Angeles all the way up to San Francisco. It is only the brevity of \nlifetimes that keeps us from appreciating the changes. Look at a globe and what you are \nseeing really is a snapshot of the continents as they have been for just one-tenth of 1 percent \nof the Earth\u2019s history. \n    Earth is alone among the rocky planets in having tectonics, and why this should be is a bit \nof a mystery. It is not simply a matter of size or density\u2014Venus is nearly a twin of Earth in \nthese respects and yet has no tectonic activity. It is thought\u2014though it is really nothing more \nthan a thought\u2014that tectonics is an important part of the planet\u2019s organic well-being. As the \nphysicist and writer James Trefil has put it, \u201cIt would be hard to believe that the continuous \nmovement of tectonic plates has no effect on the development of life on earth.\u201d He suggests \nthat the challenges induced by tectonics\u2014changes in climate, for instance\u2014were an \nimportant spur to the development of intelligence. Others believe the driftings of the \ncontinents may have produced at least some of the Earth\u2019s various extinction events. In \nNovember of 2002, Tony Dickson of Cambridge University in England produced a report, \npublished in the journal Science, strongly suggesting that there may well be a relationship \nbetween the history of rocks and the history of life. What Dickson established was that the \nchemical composition of the world\u2019s oceans has altered abruptly and vigorously throughout \nthe past half billion years and that these changes often correlate with important events in \nbiological history\u2014the huge outburst of tiny organisms that created the chalk cliffs of \nEngland\u2019s south coast, the sudden fashion for shells among marine organisms during theCambrian period, and so on. No one can say what causes the oceans\u2019 chemistry to change so \ndramatically from time to time, but the opening and shutting of ocean ridges would be an \nobvious possible culprit. \n  \n    At all events, plate tectonics not only explained the surface dynamics of the Earth\u2014how an \nancient Hipparion got from France to Florida, for example\u2014but also many of its internal \nactions. Earthquakes, the formation of island chains, the carbon cycle, the locations of \nmountains, the coming of ice ages, the origins of life itself\u2014there was hardly a matter that \nwasn\u2019t directly influenced by this remarkable new theory. Geologists, as McPhee has noted, \nfound themselves in the giddying position that \u201cthe whole earth suddenly made sense.\u201d \n    But only up to a point. The distribution of continents in former times is much less neatly \nresolved than most people outside geophysics think. Although textbooks give confident-\nlooking representations of ancient landmasses with names like Laurasia, Gondwana, Rodinia, \nand Pangaea, these are sometimes based on conclusions that don\u2019t altogether hold up. As \nGeorge Gaylord Simpson observes in Fossils and the History of Life, species of plants and \nanimals from the ancient world have a habit of appearing inconveniently where they shouldn\u2019t \nand failing to be where they ought. \n    The outline of Gondwana, a once-mighty continent connecting Australia, Africa, \nAntarctica, and South America, was based in large part on the distribution of a genus of \nancient tongue fern called Glossopteris, which was found in all the right places. However, \nmuch later Glossopteris was also discovered in parts of the world that had no known \nconnection to Gondwana. This troubling discrepancy was\u2014and continues to be\u2014mostly \nignored. Similarly a Triassic reptile called Lystrosaurus has been found from Antarctica all \nthe way to Asia, supporting the idea of a former connection between those continents, but it \nhas never turned up in South America or Australia, which are believed to have been part of \nthe same continent at the same time. \n    There are also many surface features that tectonics can\u2019t explain. Take Denver. It is, as \neveryone knows, a mile high, but that rise is comparatively recent. When dinosaurs roamed \nthe Earth, Denver was part of an ocean bottom, many thousands of feet lower. Yet the rocks \non which Denver sits are not fractured or deformed in the way they would be if Denver had \nbeen pushed up by colliding plates, and anyway Denver was too far from the plate edges to be \nsusceptible to their actions. It would be as if you pushed against the edge of a rug hoping to \nraise a ruck at the opposite end. Mysteriously and over millions of years, it appears that \nDenver has been rising, like baking bread. So, too, has much of southern Africa; a portion of \nit a thousand miles across has risen nearly a mile in 100 million years without any known \nassociated tectonic activity. Australia, meanwhile, has been tilting and sinking. Over the past \n100 million years as it has drifted north toward Asia, its leading edge has sunk by some six \nhundred feet. It appears that Indonesia is very slowly drowning, and dragging Australia down \nwith it. Nothing in the theories of tectonics can explain any of this. \n  \n    Alfred Wegener never lived to see his ideas vindicated. On an expedition to Greenland in \n1930, he set out alone, on his fiftieth birthday, to check out a supply drop. He never returned. \nHe was found a few days later, frozen to death on the ice. He was buried on the spot and lies \nthere yet, but about a yard closer to North America than on the day he died.Einstein also failed to live long enough to see that he had backed the wrong horse. In fact, \nhe died at Princeton, New Jersey, in 1955 before Charles Hapgood\u2019s rubbishing of continental \ndrift theories was even published. \n    The other principal player in the emergence of tectonics theory, Harry Hess, was also at \nPrinceton at the time, and would spend the rest of his career there. One of his students was a \nbright young fellow named Walter Alvarez, who would eventually change the world of \nscience in a quite different way. \n    As for geology itself, its cataclysms had only just begun, and it was young Alvarez who \nhelped to start the process.PART IV      DANGEROUS PLANET \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe history of any one part of the  \n \n \n \nEarth, like the life of a soldier, consists  \n \n \n \nof long periods of boredom and  \n \n \n \nshort periods of terror. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-British geologist Derek V. Ager", "13": "13    BANG! \n \n \n \n \nPEOPLE KNEW FOR a long time that there was something odd about the earth beneath \nManson, Iowa. In 1912, a man drilling a well for the town water supply reported bringing up a \nlot of strangely deformed rock\u2014\u201ccrystalline clast breccia with a melt matrix\u201d and \u201coverturned \nejecta flap,\u201d as it was later described in an official report. The water was odd too. It was \nalmost as soft as rainwater. Naturally occurring soft water had never been found in Iowa \nbefore. \n    Though Manson\u2019s strange rocks and silken waters were matters of curiosity, forty-one \nyears would pass before a team from the University of Iowa got around to making a trip to the \ncommunity, then as now a town of about two thousand people in the northwest part of the \nstate. In 1953, after sinking a series of experimental bores, university geologists agreed that \nthe site was indeed anomalous and attributed the deformed rocks to some ancient, unspecified \nvolcanic action. This was in keeping with the wisdom of the day, but it was also about as \nwrong as a geological conclusion can get. \n    The trauma to Manson\u2019s geology had come not from within the Earth, but from at least 100 \nmillion miles beyond. Sometime in the very ancient past, when Manson stood on the edge of a \nshallow sea, a rock about a mile and a half across, weighing ten billion tons and traveling at \nperhaps two hundred times the speed of sound ripped through the atmosphere and punched \ninto the Earth with a violence and suddenness that we can scarcely imagine. Where Manson \nnow stands became in an instant a hole three miles deep and more than twenty miles across. \nThe limestone that elsewhere gives Iowa its hard mineralized water was obliterated and \nreplaced by the shocked basement rocks that so puzzled the water driller in 1912. \n    The Manson impact was the biggest thing that has ever occurred on the mainland United \nStates. Of any type. Ever. The crater it left behind was so colossal that if you stood on one \nedge you would only just be able to see the other side on a good day. It would make the Grand \nCanyon look quaint and trifling. Unfortunately for lovers of spectacle, 2.5 million years of \npassing ice sheets filled the Manson crater right to the top with rich glacial till, then graded it \nsmooth, so that today the landscape at Manson, and for miles around, is as flat as a tabletop. \nWhich is of course why no one has ever heard of the Manson crater. \n    At the library in Manson they are delighted to show you a collection of newspaper articles \nand a box of core samples from a 1991\u201392 drilling program\u2014indeed, they positively bustle to \nproduce them\u2014but you have to ask to see them. Nothing permanent is on display, and \nnowhere in the town is there any historical marker. \n    To most people in Manson the biggest thing ever to happen was a tornado that rolled up \nMain Street in 1979, tearing apart the business district. One of the advantages of all that \nsurrounding flatness is that you can see danger from a long way off. Virtually the whole town \nturned out at one end of Main Street and watched for half an hour as the tornado came towardthem, hoping it would veer off, then prudently scampered when it did not. Four of them, alas, \ndidn\u2019t move quite fast enough and were killed. Every June now Manson has a weeklong event \ncalled Crater Days, which was dreamed up as a way of helping people forget that unhappy \nanniversary. It doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with the crater. Nobody\u2019s figured out a way \nto capitalize on an impact site that isn\u2019t visible. \n    \u201cVery occasionally we get people coming in and asking where they should go to see the \ncrater and we have to tell them that there is nothing to see,\u201d says Anna Schlapkohl, the town\u2019s \nfriendly librarian. \u201cThen they go away kind of disappointed.\u201d However, most people, \nincluding most Iowans, have never heard of the Manson crater. Even for geologists it barely \nrates a footnote. But for one brief period in the 1980s, Manson was the most geologically \nexciting place on Earth. \n    The story begins in the early 1950s when a bright young geologist named Eugene \nShoemaker paid a visit to Meteor Crater in Arizona. Today Meteor Crater is the most famous \nimpact site on Earth and a popular tourist attraction. In those days, however, it didn\u2019t receive \nmany visitors and was still often referred to as Barringer Crater, after a wealthy mining \nengineer named Daniel M. Barringer who had staked a claim on it in 1903. Barringer believed \nthat the crater had been formed by a ten-million-ton meteor, heavily freighted with iron and \nnickel, and it was his confident expectation that he would make a fortune digging it out. \nUnaware that the meteor and everything in it would have been vaporized on impact, he \nwasted a fortune, and the next twenty-six years, cutting tunnels that yielded nothing. \n    By the standards of today, crater research in the early 1900s was a trifle unsophisticated, to \nsay the least. The leading early investigator, G. K. Gilbert of Columbia University, modeled \nthe effects of impacts by flinging marbles into pans of oatmeal. (For reasons I cannot supply, \nGilbert conducted these experiments not in a laboratory at Columbia but in a hotel room.) \nSomehow from this Gilbert concluded that the Moon\u2019s craters were indeed formed by \nimpacts\u2014in itself quite a radical notion for the time\u2014but that the Earth\u2019s were not. Most \nscientists refused to go even that far. To them, the Moon\u2019s craters were evidence of ancient \nvolcanoes and nothing more. The few craters that remained evident on Earth (most had been \neroded away) were generally attributed to other causes or treated as fluky rarities. \n    By the time Shoemaker came along, a common view was that Meteor Crater had been \nformed by an underground steam explosion. Shoemaker knew nothing about underground \nsteam explosions\u2014he couldn\u2019t: they don\u2019t exist\u2014but he did know all about blast zones. One \nof his first jobs out of college was to study explosion rings at the Yucca Flats nuclear test site \nin Nevada. He concluded, as Barringer had before him, that there was nothing at Meteor \nCrater to suggest volcanic activity, but that there were huge distributions of other stuff\u2014\nanomalous fine silicas and magnetites principally\u2014that suggested an impact from space. \nIntrigued, he began to study the subject in his spare time. \n    Working first with his colleague Eleanor Helin and later with his wife, Carolyn, and \nassociate David Levy, Shoemaker began a systematic survey of the inner solar system. They \nspent one week each month at the Palomar Observatory in California looking for objects, \nasteroids primarily, whose trajectories carried them across Earth\u2019s orbit. \n    \u201cAt the time we started, only slightly more than a dozen of these things had ever been \ndiscovered in the entire course of astronomical observation,\u201d Shoemaker recalled some years \nlater in a television interview. \u201cAstronomers in the twentieth century essentially abandoned \nthe solar system,\u201d he added. \u201cTheir attention was turned to the stars, the galaxies.\u201dWhat Shoemaker and his colleagues found was that there was more risk out there\u2014a great \ndeal more\u2014than anyone had ever imagined. \n    Asteroids, as most people know, are rocky objects orbiting in loose formation in a belt \nbetween Mars and Jupiter. In illustrations they are always shown as existing in a jumble, but \nin fact the solar system is quite a roomy place and the average asteroid actually will be about \na million miles from its nearest neighbor. Nobody knows even approximately how many \nasteroids there are tumbling through space, but the number is thought to be probably not less \nthan a billion. They are presumed to be planets that never quite made it, owing to the \nunsettling gravitational pull of Jupiter, which kept\u2014and keeps\u2014them from coalescing. \n    When asteroids were first detected in the 1800s\u2014the very first was discovered on the first \nday of the century by a Sicilian named Giuseppi Piazzi\u2014they were thought to be planets, and \nthe first two were named Ceres and Pallas. It took some inspired deductions by the \nastronomer William Herschel to work out that they were nowhere near planet sized but much \nsmaller. He called them asteroids\u2014Latin for \u201cstarlike\u201d\u2014which was slightly unfortunate as \nthey are not like stars at all. Sometimes now they are more accurately called planetoids. \n    Finding asteroids became a popular activity in the 1800s, and by the end of the century \nabout a thousand were known. The problem was that no one was systematically recording \nthem. By the early 1900s, it had often become impossible to know whether an asteroid that \npopped into view was new or simply one that had been noted earlier and then lost track of. By \nthis time, too, astrophysics had moved on so much that few astronomers wanted to devote \ntheir lives to anything as mundane as rocky planetoids. Only a few astronomers, notably \nGerard Kuiper, the Dutch-born astronomer for whom the Kuiper belt of comets is named, \ntook any interest in the solar system at all. Thanks to his work at the McDonald Observatory \nin Texas, followed later by work done by others at the Minor Planet Center in Cincinnati and \nthe Spacewatch project in Arizona, a long list of lost asteroids was gradually whittled down \nuntil by the close of the twentieth century only one known asteroid was unaccounted for\u2014an \nobject called 719 Albert. Last seen in October 1911, it was finally tracked down in 2000 after \nbeing missing for eighty-nine years. \n    So from the point of view of asteroid research the twentieth century was essentially just a \nlong exercise in bookkeeping. It is really only in the last few years that astronomers have \nbegun to count and keep an eye on the rest of the asteroid community. As of July 2001, \ntwenty-six thousand asteroids had been named and identified\u2014half in just the previous two \nyears. With up to a billion to identify, the count obviously has barely begun. \n    In a sense it hardly matters. Identifying an asteroid doesn\u2019t make it safe. Even if every \nasteroid in the solar system had a name and known orbit, no one could say what perturbations \nmight send any of them hurtling toward us. We can\u2019t forecast rock disturbances on our own \nsurface. Put them adrift in space and what they might do is beyond guessing. Any asteroid out \nthere that has our name on it is very likely to have no other. \n    Think of the Earth\u2019s orbit as a kind of freeway on which we are the only vehicle, but which \nis crossed regularly by pedestrians who don\u2019t know enough to look before stepping off the \ncurb. At least 90 percent of these pedestrians are quite unknown to us. We don\u2019t know where \nthey live, what sort of hours they keep, how often they come our way. All we know is that at \nsome point, at uncertain intervals, they trundle across the road down which we are cruising at \nsixty-six thousand miles an hour. As Steven Ostro of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has put it, \n\u201cSuppose that there was a button you could push and you could light up all the Earth-crossingasteroids larger than about ten meters, there would be over 100 million of these objects in the \nsky.\u201d In short, you would see not a couple of thousand distant twinkling stars, but millions \nupon millions upon millions of nearer, randomly moving objects\u2014\u201call of which are capable \nof colliding with the Earth and all of which are moving on slightly different courses through \nthe sky at different rates. It would be deeply unnerving.\u201d Well, be unnerved because it is \nthere. We just can\u2019t see it. \n    Altogether it is thought\u2014though it is really only a guess, based on extrapolating from \ncratering rates on the Moon\u2014that some two thousand asteroids big enough to imperil \ncivilized existence regularly cross our orbit. But even a small asteroid\u2014the size of a house, \nsay\u2014could destroy a city. The number of these relative tiddlers in Earth-crossing orbits is \nalmost certainly in the hundreds of thousands and possibly in the millions, and they are nearly \nimpossible to track. \n    The first one wasn\u2019t spotted until 1991, and that was after it had already gone by. Named \n1991 BA, it was noticed as it sailed past us at a distance of 106,000 miles\u2014in cosmic terms \nthe equivalent of a bullet passing through one\u2019s sleeve without touching the arm. Two years \nlater, another, somewhat larger asteroid missed us by just 90,000 miles\u2014the closest pass yet \nrecorded. It, too, was not seen until it had passed and would have arrived without warning. \nAccording to Timothy Ferris, writing in the New Yorker, such near misses probably happen \ntwo or three times a week and go unnoticed. \n    An object a hundred yards across couldn\u2019t be picked up by any Earth-based telescope until \nit was within just a few days of us, and that is only if a telescope happened to be trained on it, \nwhich is unlikely because even now the number of people searching for such objects is \nmodest. The arresting analogy that is always made is that the number of people in the world \nwho are actively searching for asteroids is fewer than the staff of a typical McDonald\u2019s \nrestaurant. (It is actually somewhat higher now. But not much.) \n  \n    While Gene Shoemaker was trying to get people galvanized about the potential dangers of \nthe inner solar system, another development\u2014wholly unrelated on the face of it\u2014was quietly \nunfolding in Italy with the work of a young geologist from the Lamont Doherty Laboratory at \nColumbia University. In the early 1970s, Walter Alvarez was doing fieldwork in a comely \ndefile known as the Bottaccione Gorge, near the Umbrian hill town of Gubbio, when he grew \ncurious about a thin band of reddish clay that divided two ancient layers of limestone\u2014one \nfrom the Cretaceous period, the other from the Tertiary. This is a point known to geology as \nthe KT boundary,1 and it marks the time, sixty-five million years ago, when the dinosaurs and \nroughly half the world\u2019s other species of animals abruptly vanish from the fossil record. \nAlvarez wondered what it was about a thin lamina of clay, barely a quarter of an inch thick, \nthat could account for such a dramatic moment in Earth\u2019s history. \n    At the time the conventional wisdom about the dinosaur extinction was the same as it had \nbeen in Charles Lyell\u2019s day a century earlier\u2014namely that the dinosaurs had died out over \nmillions of years. But the thinness of the clay layer clearly suggested that in Umbria, if \n                                                 \n1 It is KT rather than CT because C had already been appropriated for Cambrian. Depending on which source \nyou credit, the K comes either from the Greek Kreta or German Kreide. Both conveniently mean \u201cchalk,\u201d which \nis also what Cretaceous means.nowhere else, something rather more abrupt had happened. Unfortunately in the 1970s no \ntests existed for determining how long such a deposit might have taken to accumulate. \n    In the normal course of things, Alvarez almost certainly would have had to leave the \nproblem at that, but luckily he had an impeccable connection to someone outside his \ndiscipline who could help\u2014his father, Luis. Luis Alvarez was an eminent nuclear physicist; \nhe had won the Nobel Prize for physics the previous decade. He had always been mildly \nscornful of his son\u2019s attachment to rocks, but this problem intrigued him. It occurred to him \nthat the answer might lie in dust from space. \n    Every year the Earth accumulates some thirty thousand metric tons of \u201ccosmic \nspherules\u201d\u2014space dust in plainer language\u2014which would be quite a lot if you swept it into \none pile, but is infinitesimal when spread across the globe. Scattered through this thin dusting \nare exotic elements not normally much found on Earth. Among these is the element iridium, \nwhich is a thousand times more abundant in space than in the Earth\u2019s crust (because, it is \nthought, most of the iridium on Earth sank to the core when the planet was young). \n    Alvarez knew that a colleague of his at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California, \nFrank Asaro, had developed a technique for measuring very precisely the chemical \ncomposition of clays using a process called neutron activation analysis. This involved \nbombarding samples with neutrons in a small nuclear reactor and carefully counting the \ngamma rays that were emitted; it was extremely finicky work. Previously Asaro had used the \ntechnique to analyze pieces of pottery, but Alvarez reasoned that if they measured the amount \nof one of the exotic elements in his son\u2019s soil samples and compared that with its annual rate \nof deposition, they would know how long it had taken the samples to form. On an October \nafternoon in 1977, Luis and Walter Alvarez dropped in on Asaro and asked him if he would \nrun the necessary tests for them. \n    It was really quite a presumptuous request. They were asking Asaro to devote months to \nmaking the most painstaking measurements of geological samples merely to confirm what \nseemed entirely self-evident to begin with\u2014that the thin layer of clay had been formed as \nquickly as its thinness suggested. Certainly no one expected his survey to yield any dramatic \nbreakthroughs. \n    \u201cWell, they were very charming, very persuasive,\u201d Asaro recalled in an interview in 2002. \n\u201cAnd it seemed an interesting challenge, so I agreed to try. Unfortunately, I had a lot of other \nwork on, so it was eight months before I could get to it.\u201d He consulted his notes from the \nperiod. \u201cOn June 21, 1978, at 1:45 p.m., we put a sample in the detector. It ran for 224 \nminutes and we could see we were getting interesting results, so we stopped it and had a \nlook.\u201d \n    The results were so unexpected, in fact, that the three scientists at first thought they had to \nbe wrong. The amount of iridium in the Alvarez sample was more than three hundred times \nnormal levels\u2014far beyond anything they might have predicted. Over the following months \nAsaro and his colleague Helen Michel worked up to thirty hours at a stretch (\u201cOnce you \nstarted you couldn\u2019t stop,\u201d Asaro explained) analyzing samples, always with the same results. \nTests on other samples\u2014from Denmark, Spain, France, New Zealand, Antarctica\u2014showed \nthat the iridium deposit was worldwide and greatly elevated everywhere, sometimes by as \nmuch as five hundred times normal levels. Clearly something big and abrupt, and probably \ncataclysmic, had produced this arresting spike.After much thought, the Alvarezes concluded that the most plausible explanation\u2014\nplausible to them, at any rate\u2014was that the Earth had been struck by an asteroid or comet. \n    The idea that the Earth might be subjected to devastating impacts from time to time was not \nquite as new as it is now sometimes presented. As far back as 1942, a Northwestern \nUniversity astrophysicist named Ralph B. Baldwin had suggested such a possibility in an \narticle in Popular Astronomy magazine. (He published the article there because no academic \npublisher was prepared to run it.) And at least two well-known scientists, the astronomer \nErnst \u00d6pik and the chemist and Nobel laureate Harold Urey, had also voiced support for the \nnotion at various times. Even among paleontologists it was not unknown. In 1956 a professor \nat Oregon State University, M. W. de Laubenfels, writing in the Journal of Paleontology, had \nactually anticipated the Alvarez theory by suggesting that the dinosaurs may have been dealt a \ndeath blow by an impact from space, and in 1970 the president of the American \nPaleontological Society, Dewey J. McLaren, proposed at the group\u2019s annual conference the \npossibility that an extraterrestrial impact may have been the cause of an earlier event known \nas the Frasnian extinction. \n    As if to underline just how un-novel the idea had become by this time, in 1979 a \nHollywood studio actually produced a movie called Meteor (\u201cIt\u2019s five miles wide . . . It\u2019s \ncoming at 30,000 m.p.h.\u2014and there\u2019s no place to hide!\u201d) starring Henry Fonda, Natalie \nWood, Karl Malden, and a very large rock. \n    So when, in the first week of 1980, at a meeting of the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science, the Alvarezes announced their belief that the dinosaur extinction \nhad not taken place over millions of years as part of some slow inexorable process, but \nsuddenly in a single explosive event, it shouldn\u2019t have come as a shock. \n    But it did. It was received everywhere, but particularly in the paleontological community, \nas an outrageous heresy. \n    \u201cWell, you have to remember,\u201d Asaro recalls, \u201cthat we were amateurs in this field. Walter \nwas a geologist specializing in paleomagnetism, Luis was a physicist and I was a nuclear \nchemist. And now here we were telling paleontologists that we had solved a problem that had \neluded them for over a century. It\u2019s not terribly surprising that they didn\u2019t embrace it \nimmediately.\u201d As Luis Alvarez joked: \u201cWe were caught practicing geology without a \nlicense.\u201d \n    But there was also something much deeper and more fundamentally abhorrent in the impact \ntheory. The belief that terrestrial processes were gradual had been elemental in natural history \nsince the time of Lyell. By the 1980s, catastrophism had been out of fashion for so long that it \nhad become literally unthinkable. For most geologists the idea of a devastating impact was, as \nEugene Shoemaker noted, \u201cagainst their scientific religion.\u201d \n    Nor did it help that Luis Alvarez was openly contemptuous of paleontologists and their \ncontributions to scientific knowledge. \u201cThey\u2019re really not very good scientists. They\u2019re more \nlike stamp collectors,\u201d he wrote in the New York Times in an article that stings yet. \n    Opponents of the Alvarez theory produced any number of alternative explanations for the \niridium deposits\u2014for instance, that they were generated by prolonged volcanic eruptions in \nIndia called the Deccan Traps\u2014and above all insisted that there was no proof that the \ndinosaurs disappeared abruptly from the fossil record at the iridium boundary. One of themost vigorous opponents was Charles Officer of Dartmouth College. He insisted that the \niridium had been deposited by volcanic action even while conceding in a newspaper interview \nthat he had no actual evidence of it. As late as 1988 more than half of all American \npaleontologists contacted in a survey continued to believe that the extinction of the dinosaurs \nwas in no way related to an asteroid or cometary impact. \n    The one thing that would most obviously support the Alvarezes\u2019 theory was the one thing \nthey didn\u2019t have\u2014an impact site. Enter Eugene Shoemaker. Shoemaker had an Iowa \nconnection\u2014his daughter-in-law taught at the University of Iowa\u2014and he was familiar with \nthe Manson crater from his own studies. Thanks to him, all eyes now turned to Iowa. \n  \n    Geology is a profession that varies from place to place. In Iowa, a state that is flat and \nstratigraphically uneventful, it tends to be comparatively serene. There are no Alpine peaks or \ngrinding glaciers, no great deposits of oil or precious metals, not a hint of a pyroclastic flow. \nIf you are a geologist employed by the state of Iowa, a big part of the work you do is to \nevaluate Manure Management Plans, which all the state\u2019s \u201canimal confinement operators\u201d\u2014\nhog farmers to the rest of us\u2014are required to file periodically. There are fifteen million hogs \nin Iowa, so a lot of manure to manage. I\u2019m not mocking this at all\u2014it\u2019s vital and enlightened \nwork; it keeps Iowa\u2019s water clean\u2014but with the best will in the world it\u2019s not exactly dodging \nlava bombs on Mount Pinatubo or scrabbling over crevasses on the Greenland ice sheet in \nsearch of ancient life-bearing quartzes. So we may well imagine the flutter of excitement that \nswept through the Iowa Department of Natural Resources when in the mid-1980s the world\u2019s \ngeological attention focused on Manson and its crater. \n    Trowbridge Hall in Iowa City is a turn-of-the-century pile of red brick that houses the \nUniversity of Iowa\u2019s Earth Sciences department and\u2014way up in a kind of garret\u2014the \ngeologists of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. No one now can remember quite \nwhen, still less why, the state geologists were placed in an academic facility, but you get the \nimpression that the space was conceded grudgingly, for the offices are cramped and low-\nceilinged and not very accessible. When being shown the way, you half expect to be taken out \nonto a roof ledge and helped in through a window. \n    Ray Anderson and Brian Witzke spend their working lives up here amid disordered heaps \nof papers, journals, furled charts, and hefty specimen stones. (Geologists are never at a loss \nfor paperweights.) It\u2019s the kind of space where if you want to find anything\u2014an extra chair, a \ncoffee cup, a ringing telephone\u2014you have to move stacks of documents around. \n    \u201cSuddenly we were at the center of things,\u201d Anderson told me, gleaming at the memory of \nit, when I met him and Witzke in their offices on a dismal, rainy morning in June. \u201cIt was a \nwonderful time.\u201d \n    I asked them about Gene Shoemaker, a man who seems to have been universally revered. \n\u201cHe was just a great guy,\u201d Witzke replied without hesitation. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for him, the \nwhole thing would never have gotten off the ground. Even with his support, it took two years \nto get it up and running. Drilling\u2019s an expensive business\u2014about thirty-five dollars a foot \nback then, more now, and we needed to go down three thousand feet.\u201d \n    \u201cSometimes more than that,\u201d Anderson added.\u201cSometimes more than that,\u201d Witzke agreed. \u201cAnd at several locations. So you\u2019re talking a \nlot of money. Certainly more than our budget would allow.\u201d \n    So a collaboration was formed between the Iowa Geological Survey and the U.S. \nGeological Survey. \n    \u201cAt least we thought it was a collaboration,\u201d said Anderson, producing a small pained \nsmile. \n    \u201cIt was a real learning curve for us,\u201d Witzke went on. \u201cThere was actually quite a lot of bad \nscience going on throughout the period\u2014people rushing in with results that didn\u2019t always \nstand up to scrutiny.\u201d One of those moments came at the annual meeting of the American \nGeophysical Union in 1985, when Glenn Izett and C. L. Pillmore of the U.S. Geological \nSurvey announced that the Manson crater was of the right age to have been involved with the \ndinosaurs\u2019 extinction. The declaration attracted a good deal of press attention but was \nunfortunately premature. A more careful examination of the data revealed that Manson was \nnot only too small, but also nine million years too early. \n    The first Anderson or Witzke learned of this setback to their careers was when they arrived \nat a conference in South Dakota and found people coming up to them with sympathetic looks \nand saying: \u201cWe hear you lost your crater.\u201d It was the first they knew that Izett and the other \nUSGS scientists had just announced refined figures revealing that Manson couldn\u2019t after all \nhave been the extinction crater. \n    \u201cIt was pretty stunning,\u201d recalls Anderson. \u201cI mean, we had this thing that was really \nimportant and then suddenly we didn\u2019t have it anymore. But even worse was the realization \nthat the people we thought we\u2019d been collaborating with hadn\u2019t bothered to share with us their \nnew findings.\u201d \n    \u201cWhy not?\u201d \n    He shrugged. \u201cWho knows? Anyway, it was a pretty good insight into how unattractive \nscience can get when you\u2019re playing at a certain level.\u201d \n    The search moved elsewhere. By chance in 1990 one of the searchers, Alan Hildebrand of \nthe University of Arizona, met a reporter from the Houston Chronicle who happened to know \nabout a large, unexplained ring formation, 120 miles wide and 30 miles deep, under Mexico\u2019s \nYucat\u00e1n Peninsula at Chicxulub, near the city of Progreso, about 600 miles due south of New \nOrleans. The formation had been found by Pemex, the Mexican oil company, in 1952\u2014the \nyear, coincidentally, that Gene Shoemaker first visited Meteor Crater in Arizona\u2014but the \ncompany\u2019s geologists had concluded that it was volcanic, in line with the thinking of the day. \nHildebrand traveled to the site and decided fairly swiftly that they had their crater. By early \n1991 it had been established to nearly everyone\u2019s satisfaction that Chicxulub was the impact \nsite. \n    Still, many people didn\u2019t quite grasp what an impact could do. As Stephen Jay Gould \nrecalled in one of his essays: \u201cI remember harboring some strong initial doubts about the \nefficacy of such an event . . . [W]hy should an object only six miles across wreak such havoc \nupon a planet with a diameter of eight thousand miles?\u201dConveniently a natural test of the theory arose when the Shoemakers and Levy discovered \nComet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which they soon realized was headed for Jupiter. For the first time, \nhumans would be able to witness a cosmic collision\u2014and witness it very well thanks to the \nnew Hubble space telescope. Most astronomers, according to Curtis Peebles, expected little, \nparticularly as the comet was not a coherent sphere but a string of twenty-one fragments. \u201cMy \nsense,\u201d wrote one, \u201cis that Jupiter will swallow these comets up without so much as a burp.\u201d \nOne week before the impact, Nature ran an article, \u201cThe Big Fizzle Is Coming,\u201d predicting \nthat the impact would constitute nothing more than a meteor shower. \n   The impacts began on July 16, 1994, went on for a week and were bigger by far than \nanyone\u2014with the possible exception of Gene Shoemaker\u2014expected. One fragment, known \nas Nucleus G, struck with the force of about six million megatons\u2014seventy-five times more \nthan all the nuclear weaponry in existence. Nucleus G was only about the size of a small \nmountain, but it created wounds in the Jovian surface the size of Earth. It was the final blow \nfor critics of the Alvarez theory. \n    Luis Alvarez never knew of the discovery of the Chicxulub crater or of the Shoemaker-\nLevy comet, as he died in 1988. Shoemaker also died early. On the third anniversary of the \nShoemaker-Levy impact, he and his wife were in the Australian outback, where they went \nevery year to search for impact sites. On a dirt track in the Tanami Desert\u2014normally one of \nthe emptiest places on Earth\u2014they came over a slight rise just as another vehicle was \napproaching. Shoemaker was killed instantly, his wife injured. Part of his ashes were sent to \nthe Moon aboard the Lunar Prospector spacecraft. The rest were scattered around Meteor \nCrater. \n  \n    Anderson and Witzke no longer had the crater that killed the dinosaurs, \u201cbut we still had \nthe largest and most perfectly preserved impact crater in the mainland United States,\u201d \nAnderson said. (A little verbal dexterity is required to keep Manson\u2019s superlative status. Other \ncraters are larger\u2014notably, Chesapeake Bay, which was recognized as an impact site in \n1994\u2014but they are either offshore or deformed.) \u201cChicxulub is buried under two to three \nkilometers of limestone and mostly offshore, which makes it difficult to study,\u201d Anderson \nwent on, \u201cwhile Manson is really quite accessible. It\u2019s because it is buried that it is actually \ncomparatively pristine.\u201d \n    I asked them how much warning we would receive if a similar hunk of rock was coming \ntoward us today. \n    \u201cOh, probably none,\u201d said Anderson breezily. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be visible to the naked eye until \nit warmed up, and that wouldn\u2019t happen until it hit the atmosphere, which would be about one \nsecond before it hit the Earth. You\u2019re talking about something moving many tens of times \nfaster than the fastest bullet. Unless it had been seen by someone with a telescope, and that\u2019s \nby no means a certainty, it would take us completely by surprise.\u201d \n    How hard an impactor hits depends on a lot of variables\u2014angle of entry, velocity and \ntrajectory, whether the collision is head-on or from the side, and the mass and density of the \nimpacting object, among much else\u2014none of which we can know so many millions of years \nafter the fact. But what scientists can do\u2014and Anderson and Witzke have done\u2014is measure \nthe impact site and calculate the amount of energy released. From that they can work outplausible scenarios of what it must have been like\u2014or, more chillingly, would be like if it \nhappened now. \n    An asteroid or comet traveling at cosmic velocities would enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere at \nsuch a speed that the air beneath it couldn\u2019t get out of the way and would be compressed, as in \na bicycle pump. As anyone who has used such a pump knows, compressed air grows swiftly \nhot, and the temperature below it would rise to some 60,000 Kelvin, or ten times the surface \ntemperature of the Sun. In this instant of its arrival in our atmosphere, everything in the \nmeteor\u2019s path\u2014people, houses, factories, cars\u2014would crinkle and vanish like cellophane in a \nflame. \n    One second after entering the atmosphere, the meteorite would slam into the Earth\u2019s \nsurface, where the people of Manson had a moment before been going about their business. \nThe meteorite itself would vaporize instantly, but the blast would blow out a thousand cubic \nkilometers of rock, earth, and superheated gases. Every living thing within 150 miles that \nhadn\u2019t been killed by the heat of entry would now be killed by the blast. Radiating outward at \nalmost the speed of light would be the initial shock wave, sweeping everything before it. \n    For those outside the zone of immediate devastation, the first inkling of catastrophe would \nbe a flash of blinding light\u2014the brightest ever seen by human eyes\u2014followed an instant to a \nminute or two later by an apocalyptic sight of unimaginable grandeur: a roiling wall of \ndarkness reaching high into the heavens, filling an entire field of view and traveling at \nthousands of miles an hour. Its approach would be eerily silent since it would be moving far \nbeyond the speed of sound. Anyone in a tall building in Omaha or Des Moines, say, who \nchanced to look in the right direction would see a bewildering veil of turmoil followed by \ninstantaneous oblivion. \n    Within minutes, over an area stretching from Denver to Detroit and encompassing what had \nonce been Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, the Twin Cities\u2014the whole of the Midwest, in \nshort\u2014nearly every standing thing would be flattened or on fire, and nearly every living thing \nwould be dead. People up to a thousand miles away would be knocked off their feet and sliced \nor clobbered by a blizzard of flying projectiles. Beyond a thousand miles the devastation from \nthe blast would gradually diminish. \n    But that\u2019s just the initial shockwave. No one can do more than guess what the associated \ndamage would be, other than that it would be brisk and global. The impact would almost \ncertainly set off a chain of devastating earthquakes. Volcanoes across the globe would begin \nto rumble and spew. Tsunamis would rise up and head devastatingly for distant shores. Within \nan hour, a cloud of blackness would cover the planet, and burning rock and other debris \nwould be pelting down everywhere, setting much of the planet ablaze. It has been estimated \nthat at least a billion and a half people would be dead by the end of the first day. The massive \ndisturbances to the ionosphere would knock out communications systems everywhere, so \nsurvivors would have no idea what was happening elsewhere or where to turn. It would hardly \nmatter. As one commentator has put it, fleeing would mean \u201cselecting a slow death over a \nquick one. The death toll would be very little affected by any plausible relocation effort, since \nEarth\u2019s ability to support life would be universally diminished.\u201d \n    The amount of soot and floating ash from the impact and following fires would blot out the \nsun, certainly for months, possibly for years, disrupting growing cycles. In 2001 researchers at \nthe California Institute of Technology analyzed helium isotopes from sediments left from the \nlater KT impact and concluded that it affected Earth\u2019s climate for about ten thousand years.This was actually used as evidence to support the notion that the extinction of dinosaurs was \nswift and emphatic\u2014and so it was in geological terms. We can only guess how well, or \nwhether, humanity would cope with such an event. \n    And in all likelihood, remember, this would come without warning, out of a clear sky. \n    But let\u2019s assume we did see the object coming. What would we do? Everyone assumes we \nwould send up a nuclear warhead and blast it to smithereens. The idea has some problems, \nhowever. First, as John S. Lewis notes, our missiles are not designed for space work. They \nhaven\u2019t the oomph to escape Earth\u2019s gravity and, even if they did, there are no mechanisms to \nguide them across tens of millions of miles of space. Still less could we send up a shipload of \nspace cowboys to do the job for us, as in the movie Armageddon; we no longer possess a \nrocket powerful enough to send humans even as far as the Moon. The last rocket that could, \nSaturn 5, was retired years ago and has never been replaced. Nor could we quickly build a \nnew one because, amazingly, the plans for Saturn launchers were destroyed as part of a \nNASA housecleaning exercise. \n    Even if we did manage somehow to get a warhead to the asteroid and blasted it to pieces, \nthe chances are that we would simply turn it into a string of rocks that would slam into us one \nafter the other in the manner of Comet Shoemaker-Levy on Jupiter\u2014but with the difference \nthat now the rocks would be intensely radioactive. Tom Gehrels, an asteroid hunter at the \nUniversity of Arizona, thinks that even a year\u2019s warning would probably be insufficient to \ntake appropriate action. The greater likelihood, however, is that we wouldn\u2019t see any object\u2014\neven a comet\u2014until it was about six months away, which would be much too late. \nShoemaker-Levy 9 had been orbiting Jupiter in a fairly conspicuous manner since 1929, but it \ntook over half a century before anyone noticed. \n    Interestingly, because these things are so difficult to compute and must incorporate such a \nsignificant margin of error, even if we knew an object was heading our way we wouldn\u2019t \nknow until nearly the end\u2014the last couple of weeks anyway\u2014whether collision was certain. \nFor most of the time of the object\u2019s approach we would exist in a kind of cone of uncertainty. \nIt would certainly be the most interesting few months in the history of the world. And imagine \nthe party if it passed safely. \n    \u201cSo how often does something like the Manson impact happen?\u201d I asked Anderson and \nWitzke before leaving. \n    \u201cOh, about once every million years on average,\u201d said Witzke. \n    \u201cAnd remember,\u201d added Anderson, \u201cthis was a relatively minor event. Do you know how \nmany extinctions were associated with the Manson impact?\u201d \n    \u201cNo idea,\u201d I replied. \n    \u201cNone,\u201d he said, with a strange air of satisfaction. \u201cNot one.\u201d \n    Of course, Witzke and Anderson added hastily and more or less in unison, there would \nhave been terrible devastation across much of the Earth, as just described, and complete \nannihilation for hundreds of miles around ground zero. But life is hardy, and when the smoke \ncleared there were enough lucky survivors from every species that none permanently \nperished.The good news, it appears, is that it takes an awful lot to extinguish a species. The bad \nnews is that the good news can never be counted on. Worse still, it isn\u2019t actually necessary to \nlook to space for petrifying danger. As we are about to see, Earth can provide plenty of danger \nof its own.", "14": "14    THE FIRE BELOW \n \n \n \n \nIN THE SUMMER of 1971, a young geologist named Mike Voorhies was scouting around on \nsome grassy farmland in eastern Nebraska, not far from the little town of Orchard, where he \nhad grown up. Passing through a steep-sided gully, he spotted a curious glint in the brush \nabove and clambered up to have a look. What he had seen was the perfectly preserved skull of \na young rhinoceros, which had been washed out by recent heavy rains. \n    A few yards beyond, it turned out, was one of the most extraordinary fossil beds ever \ndiscovered in North America, a dried-up water hole that had served as a mass grave for scores \nof animals\u2014rhinoceroses, zebra-like horses, saber-toothed deer, camels, turtles. All had died \nfrom some mysterious cataclysm just under twelve million years ago in the time known to \ngeology as the Miocene. In those days Nebraska stood on a vast, hot plain very like the \nSerengeti of Africa today. The animals had been found buried under volcanic ash up to ten \nfeet deep. The puzzle of it was that there were not, and never had been, any volcanoes in \nNebraska. \n    Today, the site of Voorhies\u2019s discovery is called Ashfall Fossil Beds State Park, and it has a \nstylish new visitors\u2019 center and museum, with thoughtful displays on the geology of Nebraska \nand the history of the fossil beds. The center incorporates a lab with a glass wall through \nwhich visitors can watch paleontologists cleaning bones. Working alone in the lab on the \nmorning I passed through was a cheerfully grizzled-looking fellow in a blue work shirt whom \nI recognized as Mike Voorhies from a BBC television documentary in which he featured. \nThey don\u2019t get a huge number of visitors to Ashfall Fossil Beds State Park\u2014it\u2019s slightly in \nthe middle of nowhere\u2014and Voorhies seemed pleased to show me around. He took me to the \nspot atop a twenty-foot ravine where he had made his find. \n    \u201cIt was a dumb place to look for bones,\u201d he said happily. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t looking for bones. I \nwas thinking of making a geological map of eastern Nebraska at the time, and really just kind \nof poking around. If I hadn\u2019t gone up this ravine or the rains hadn\u2019t just washed out that skull, \nI\u2019d have walked on by and this would never have been found.\u201d He indicated a roofed \nenclosure nearby, which had become the main excavation site. Some two hundred animals \nhad been found lying together in a jumble. \n    I asked him in what way it was a dumb place to hunt for bones. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re looking for \nbones, you really need exposed rock. That\u2019s why most paleontology is done in hot, dry places. \nIt\u2019s not that there are more bones there. It\u2019s just that you have some chance of spotting them. \nIn a setting like this\u201d\u2014he made a sweeping gesture across the vast and unvarying prairie\u2014\n\u201cyou wouldn\u2019t know where to begin. There could be really magnificent stuff out there, but \nthere\u2019s no surface clues to show you where to start looking.\u201d \n    At first they thought the animals were buried alive, and Voorhies stated as much in a \nNational Geographic article in 1981. \u201cThe article called the site a \u2018Pompeii of prehistoricanimals,\u2019 \u201d he told me, \u201cwhich was unfortunate because just afterward we realized that the \nanimals hadn\u2019t died suddenly at all. They were all suffering from something called \nhypertrophic pulmonary osteodystrophy, which is what you would get if you were breathing a \nlot of abrasive ash\u2014and they must have been breathing a lot of it because the ash was feet \nthick for hundreds of miles.\u201d He picked up a chunk of grayish, claylike dirt and crumbled it \ninto my hand. It was powdery but slightly gritty. \u201cNasty stuff to have to breathe,\u201d he went on, \n\u201cbecause it\u2019s very fine but also quite sharp. So anyway they came here to this watering hole, \npresumably seeking relief, and died in some misery. The ash would have ruined everything. It \nwould have buried all the grass and coated every leaf and turned the water into an undrinkable \ngray sludge. It couldn\u2019t have been very agreeable at all.\u201d \n    The BBC documentary had suggested that the existence of so much ash in Nebraska was a \nsurprise. In fact, Nebraska\u2019s huge ash deposits had been known about for a long time. For \nalmost a century they had been mined to make household cleaning powders like Comet and \nAjax. But curiously no one had ever thought to wonder where all the ash came from. \n    \u201cI\u2019m a little embarrassed to tell you,\u201d Voorhies said, smiling briefly, \u201cthat the first I thought \nabout it was when an editor at the National Geographic asked me the source of all the ash and \nI had to confess that I didn\u2019t know. Nobody knew.\u201d \n    Voorhies sent samples to colleagues all over the western United States asking if there was \nanything about it that they recognized. Several months later a geologist named Bill \nBonnichsen from the Idaho Geological Survey got in touch and told him that the ash matched \na volcanic deposit from a place called Bruneau-Jarbidge in southwest Idaho. The event that \nkilled the plains animals of Nebraska was a volcanic explosion on a scale previously \nunimagined\u2014but big enough to leave an ash layer ten feet deep almost a thousand miles away \nin eastern Nebraska. It turned out that under the western United States there was a huge \ncauldron of magma, a colossal volcanic hot spot, which erupted cataclysmically every \n600,000 years or so. The last such eruption was just over 600,000 years ago. The hot spot is \nstill there. These days we call it Yellowstone National Park. \n  \n    We know amazingly little about what happens beneath our feet. It is fairly remarkable to \nthink that Ford has been building cars and baseball has been playing World Series for longer \nthan we have known that the Earth has a core. And of course the idea that the continents move \nabout on the surface like lily pads has been common wisdom for much less than a generation. \n\u201cStrange as it may seem,\u201d wrote Richard Feynman, \u201cwe understand the distribution of matter \nin the interior of the Sun far better than we understand the interior of the Earth.\u201d \n    The distance from the surface of Earth to the center is 3,959 miles, which isn\u2019t so very far. \nIt has been calculated that if you sunk a well to the center and dropped a brick into it, it would \ntake only forty-five minutes for it to hit the bottom (though at that point it would be \nweightless since all the Earth\u2019s gravity would be above and around it rather than beneath it). \nOur own attempts to penetrate toward the middle have been modest indeed. One or two South \nAfrican gold mines reach to a depth of two miles, but most mines on Earth go no more than \nabout a quarter of a mile beneath the surface. If the planet were an apple, we wouldn\u2019t yet \nhave broken through the skin. Indeed, we haven\u2019t even come close. \n    Until slightly under a century ago, what the best-informed scientific minds knew about \nEarth\u2019s interior was not much more than what a coal miner knew\u2014namely, that you could digdown through soil for a distance and then you\u2019d hit rock and that was about it. Then in 1906, \nan Irish geologist named R. D. Oldham, while examining some seismograph readings from an \nearthquake in Guatemala, noticed that certain shock waves had penetrated to a point deep \nwithin the Earth and then bounced off at an angle, as if they had encountered some kind of \nbarrier. From this he deduced that the Earth has a core. Three years later a Croatian \nseismologist named Andrija Mohorovi\u010di\u00b4c was studying graphs from an earthquake in Zagreb \nwhen he noticed a similar odd deflection, but at a shallower level. He had discovered the \nboundary between the crust and the layer immediately below, the mantle; this zone has been \nknown ever since as the Mohorovi\u010di\u00b4c discontinuity, or Moho for short. \n    We were beginning to get a vague idea of the Earth\u2019s layered interior\u2014though it really was \nonly vague. Not until 1936 did a Danish scientist named Inge Lehmann, studying \nseismographs of earthquakes in New Zealand, discover that there were two cores\u2014an inner \none that we now believe to be solid and an outer one (the one that Oldham had detected) that \nis thought to be liquid and the seat of magnetism. \n    At just about the time that Lehmann was refining our basic understanding of the Earth\u2019s \ninterior by studying the seismic waves of earthquakes, two geologists at Caltech in California \nwere devising a way to make comparisons between one earthquake and the next. They were \nCharles Richter and Beno Gutenberg, though for reasons that have nothing to do with fairness \nthe scale became known almost at once as Richter\u2019s alone. (It has nothing to do with Richter \neither. A modest fellow, he never referred to the scale by his own name, but always called it \n\u201cthe Magnitude Scale.\u201d) \n    The Richter scale has always been widely misunderstood by nonscientists, though perhaps \na little less so now than in its early days when visitors to Richter\u2019s office often asked to see \nhis celebrated scale, thinking it was some kind of machine. The scale is of course more an \nidea than an object, an arbitrary measure of the Earth\u2019s tremblings based on surface \nmeasurements. It rises exponentially, so that a 7.3 quake is fifty times more powerful than a \n6.3 earthquake and 2,500 times more powerful than a 5.3 earthquake. \n    At least theoretically, there is no upper limit for an earthquake\u2014nor, come to that, a lower \nlimit. The scale is a simple measure of force, but says nothing about damage. A magnitude 7 \nquake happening deep in the mantle\u2014say, four hundred miles down\u2014might cause no surface \ndamage at all, while a significantly smaller one happening just four miles under the surface \ncould wreak widespread devastation. Much, too, depends on the nature of the subsoil, the \nquake\u2019s duration, the frequency and severity of aftershocks, and the physical setting of the \naffected area. All this means that the most fearsome quakes are not necessarily the most \nforceful, though force obviously counts for a lot. \n    The largest earthquake since the scale\u2019s invention was (depending on which source you \ncredit) either one centered on Prince William Sound in Alaska in March 1964, which \nmeasured 9.2 on the Richter scale, or one in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Chile in 1960, \nwhich was initially logged at 8.6 magnitude but later revised upward by some authorities \n(including the United States Geological Survey) to a truly grand-scale 9.5. As you will gather \nfrom this, measuring earthquakes is not always an exact science, particularly when \ninterpreting readings from remote locations. At all events, both quakes were whopping. The \n1960 quake not only caused widespread damage across coastal South America, but also set off \na giant tsunami that rolled six thousand miles across the Pacific and slapped away much of \ndowntown Hilo, Hawaii, destroying five hundred buildings and killing sixty people. Similar \nwave surges claimed yet more victims as far away as Japan and the Philippines.For pure, focused, devastation, however, probably the most intense earthquake in recorded \nhistory was one that struck\u2014and essentially shook to pieces\u2014Lisbon, Portugal, on All Saints \nDay (November 1), 1755. Just before ten in the morning, the city was hit by a sudden \nsideways lurch now estimated at magnitude 9.0 and shaken ferociously for seven full minutes. \nThe convulsive force was so great that the water rushed out of the city\u2019s harbor and returned \nin a wave fifty feet high, adding to the destruction. When at last the motion ceased, survivors \nenjoyed just three minutes of calm before a second shock came, only slightly less severe than \nthe first. A third and final shock followed two hours later. At the end of it all, sixty thousand \npeople were dead and virtually every building for miles reduced to rubble. The San Francisco \nearthquake of 1906, for comparison, measured an estimated 7.8 on the Richter scale and \nlasted less than thirty seconds. \n  \n    Earthquakes are fairly common. Every day on average somewhere in the world there are \ntwo of magnitude 2.0 or greater\u2014that\u2019s enough to give anyone nearby a pretty good jolt. \nAlthough they tend to cluster in certain places\u2014notably around the rim of the Pacific\u2014they \ncan occur almost anywhere. In the United States, only Florida, eastern Texas, and the upper \nMidwest seem\u2014so far\u2014to be almost entirely immune. New England has had two quakes of \nmagnitude 6.0 or greater in the last two hundred years. In April 2002, the region experienced \na 5.1 magnitude shaking in a quake near Lake Champlain on the New York\u2013Vermont border, \ncausing extensive local damage and (I can attest) knocking pictures from walls and children \nfrom beds as far away as New Hampshire. \n    The most common types of earthquakes are those where two plates meet, as in California \nalong the San Andreas Fault. As the plates push against each other, pressures build up until \none or the other gives way. In general, the longer the interval between quakes, the greater the \npent-up pressure and thus the greater the scope for a really big jolt. This is a particular worry \nfor Tokyo, which Bill McGuire, a hazards specialist at University College London, describes \nas \u201cthe city waiting to die\u201d (not a motto you will find on many tourism leaflets). Tokyo stands \non the boundary of three tectonic plates in a country already well known for its seismic \ninstability. In 1995, as you will remember, the city of Kobe, three hundred miles to the west, \nwas struck by a magnitude 7.2 quake, which killed 6,394 people. The damage was estimated \nat $99 billion. But that was as nothing\u2014well, as comparatively little\u2014compared with what \nmay await Tokyo. \n    Tokyo has already suffered one of the most devastating earthquakes in modern times. On \nSeptember 1, 1923, just before noon, the city was hit by what is known as the Great Kanto \nquake\u2014an event more than ten times more powerful than Kobe\u2019s earthquake. Two hundred \nthousand people were killed. Since that time, Tokyo has been eerily quiet, so the strain \nbeneath the surface has been building for eighty years. Eventually it is bound to snap. In 1923, \nTokyo had a population of about three million. Today it is approaching thirty million. Nobody \ncares to guess how many people might die, but the potential economic cost has been put as \nhigh as $7 trillion. \n    Even more unnerving, because they are less well understood and capable of occurring \nanywhere at any time, are the rarer type of shakings known as intraplate quakes. These \nhappen away from plate boundaries, which makes them wholly unpredictable. And because \nthey come from a much greater depth, they tend to propagate over much wider areas. The \nmost notorious such quakes ever to hit the United States were a series of three in New \nMadrid, Missouri, in the winter of 1811\u201312. The adventure started just after midnight onDecember 16 when people were awakened first by the noise of panicking farm animals (the \nrestiveness of animals before quakes is not an old wives\u2019 tale, but is in fact well established, \nthough not at all understood) and then by an almighty rupturing noise from deep within the \nEarth. Emerging from their houses, locals found the land rolling in waves up to three feet high \nand opening up in fissures several feet deep. A strong smell of sulfur filled the air. The \nshaking lasted for four minutes with the usual devastating effects to property. Among the \nwitnesses was the artist John James Audubon, who happened to be in the area. The quake \nradiated outward with such force that it knocked down chimneys in Cincinnati four hundred \nmiles away and, according to at least one account, \u201cwrecked boats in East Coast harbors and . \n. . even collapsed scaffolding erected around the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.\u201d On \nJanuary 23 and February 4 further quakes of similar magnitude followed. New Madrid has \nbeen silent ever since\u2014but not surprisingly, since such episodes have never been known to \nhappen in the same place twice. As far as we know, they are as random as lightning. The next \none could be under Chicago or Paris or Kinshasa. No one can even begin to guess. And what \ncauses these massive intraplate rupturings? Something deep within the Earth. More than that \nwe don\u2019t know. \n  \n    By the 1960s scientists had grown sufficiently frustrated by how little they understood of \nthe Earth\u2019s interior that they decided to try to do something about it. Specifically, they got the \nidea to drill through the ocean floor (the continental crust was too thick) to the Moho \ndiscontinuity and to extract a piece of the Earth\u2019s mantle for examination at leisure. The \nthinking was that if they could understand the nature of the rocks inside the Earth, they might \nbegin to understand how they interacted, and thus possibly be able to predict earthquakes and \nother unwelcome events. \n    The project became known, all but inevitably, as the Mohole and it was pretty well \ndisastrous. The hope was to lower a drill through 14,000 feet of Pacific Ocean water off the \ncoast of Mexico and drill some 17,000 feet through relatively thin crustal rock. Drilling from \na ship in open waters is, in the words of one oceanographer, \u201clike trying to drill a hole in the \nsidewalks of New York from atop the Empire State Building using a strand of spaghetti.\u201d \nEvery attempt ended in failure. The deepest they penetrated was only about 600 feet. The \nMohole became known as the No Hole. In 1966, exasperated with ever-rising costs and no \nresults, Congress killed the project. \n    Four years later, Soviet scientists decided to try their luck on dry land. They chose a spot on \nRussia\u2019s Kola Peninsula, near the Finnish border, and set to work with the hope of drilling to \na depth of fifteen kilometers. The work proved harder than expected, but the Soviets were \ncommendably persistent. When at last they gave up, nineteen years later, they had drilled to a \ndepth of 12,262 meters, or about 7.6 miles. Bearing in mind that the crust of the Earth \nrepresents only about 0.3 percent of the planet\u2019s volume and that the Kola hole had not cut \neven one-third of the way through the crust, we can hardly claim to have conquered the \ninterior. \n    Interestingly, even though the hole was modest, nearly everything about it was surprising. \nSeismic wave studies had led the scientists to predict, and pretty confidently, that they would \nencounter sedimentary rock to a depth of 4,700 meters, followed by granite for the next 2,300 \nmeters and basalt from there on down. In the event, the sedimentary layer was 50 percent \ndeeper than expected and the basaltic layer was never found at all. Moreover, the world down \nthere was far warmer than anyone had expected, with a temperature at 10,000 meters of 180degrees centigrade, nearly twice the forecasted level. Most surprising of all was that the rock \nat that depth was saturated with water\u2014something that had not been thought possible. \n    Because we can\u2019t see into the Earth, we have to use other techniques, which mostly involve \nreading waves as they travel through the interior. We also know a little bit about the mantle \nfrom what are known as kimberlite pipes, where diamonds are formed. What happens is that \ndeep in the Earth there is an explosion that fires, in effect, a cannonball of magma to the \nsurface at supersonic speeds. It is a totally random event. A kimberlite pipe could explode in \nyour backyard as you read this. Because they come up from such depths\u2014up to 120 miles \ndown\u2014kimberlite pipes bring up all kinds of things not normally found on or near the \nsurface: a rock called peridotite, crystals of olivine, and\u2014just occasionally, in about one pipe \nin a hundred\u2014diamonds. Lots of carbon comes up with kimberlite ejecta, but most is \nvaporized or turns to graphite. Only occasionally does a hunk of it shoot up at just the right \nspeed and cool down with the necessary swiftness to become a diamond. It was such a pipe \nthat made Johannesburg the most productive diamond mining city in the world, but there may \nbe others even bigger that we don\u2019t know about. Geologists know that somewhere in the \nvicinity of northeastern Indiana there is evidence of a pipe or group of pipes that may be truly \ncolossal. Diamonds up to twenty carats or more have been found at scattered sites throughout \nthe region. But no one has ever found the source. As John McPhee notes, it may be buried \nunder glacially deposited soil, like the Manson crater in Iowa, or under the Great Lakes. \n  \n    So how much do we know about what\u2019s inside the Earth? Very little. Scientists are \ngenerally agreed that the world beneath us is composed of four layers\u2014rocky outer crust, a \nmantle of hot, viscous rock, a liquid outer core, and a solid inner core.1 We know that the \nsurface is dominated by silicates, which are relatively light and not heavy enough to account \nfor the planet\u2019s overall density. Therefore there must be heavier stuff inside. We know that to \ngenerate our magnetic field somewhere in the interior there must be a concentrated belt of \nmetallic elements in a liquid state. That much is universally agreed upon. Almost everything \nbeyond that\u2014how the layers interact, what causes them to behave in the way they do, what \nthey will do at any time in the future\u2014is a matter of at least some uncertainty, and generally \nquite a lot of uncertainty. \n    Even the one part of it we can see, the crust, is a matter of some fairly strident debate. \nNearly all geology texts tell you that continental crust is three to six miles thick under the \noceans, about twenty-five miles thick under the continents, and forty to sixty miles thick \nunder big mountain chains, but there are many puzzling variabilities within these \ngeneralizations. The crust beneath the Sierra Nevada Mountains, for instance, is only about \nnineteen to twenty-five miles thick, and no one knows why. By all the laws of geophysics the \nSierra Nevadas should be sinking, as if into quicksand. (Some people think they may be.) \n  \n                                                 \n1 For those who crave a more detailed picture of the Earth's interior, here are the dimensions of the various \nlayers, using average figures: From 0 to 40 km (25 mi) is the crust. From 40 to 400 km (25 to 250 mi) is the \nupper mantle. From 400 to 650 km (250 to 400 mi) is a transition zone between the upper and lower mantle. \nFrom 650 to 2,700 km (400 to 1,700 mi) is the lower mantle. From 2,700 to 2,890 km (1,700 to 1,900 mi) is the \n\"D\" layer. From 2,890 to 5,150 km (1,900 to 3,200 mi) is the outer core, and from 5,150 to 6,378 km (3,200 to \n3,967 mi) is the inner core.How and when the Earth got its crust are questions that divide geologists into two broad \ncamps\u2014those who think it happened abruptly early in the Earth\u2019s history and those who think \nit happened gradually and rather later. Strength of feeling runs deep on such matters. Richard \nArmstrong of Yale proposed an early-burst theory in the 1960s, then spent the rest of his \ncareer fighting those who did not agree with him. He died of cancer in 1991, but shortly \nbefore his death he \u201clashed out at his critics in a polemic in an Australian earth science journal \nthat charged them with perpetuating myths,\u201d according to a report inEarth magazine in 1998. \n\u201cHe died a bitter man,\u201d reported a colleague. \n    The crust and part of the outer mantle together are called the lithosphere (from the Greek \nlithos, meaning \u201cstone\u201d), which in turn floats on top of a layer of softer rock called the \nasthenosphere (from Greek words meaning \u201cwithout strength\u201d), but such terms are never \nentirely satisfactory. To say that the lithosphere floats on top of the asthenosphere suggests a \ndegree of easy buoyancy that isn\u2019t quite right. Similarly it is misleading to think of the rocks \nas flowing in anything like the way we think of materials flowing on the surface. The rocks \nare viscous, but only in the same way that glass is. It may not look it, but all the glass on Earth \nis flowing downward under the relentless drag of gravity. Remove a pane of really old glass \nfrom the window of a European cathedral and it will be noticeably thicker at the bottom than \nat the top. That is the sort of \u201cflow\u201d we are talking about. The hour hand on a clock moves \nabout ten thousand times faster than the \u201cflowing\u201d rocks of the mantle. \n    The movements occur not just laterally as the Earth\u2019s plates move across the surface, but up \nand down as well, as rocks rise and fall under the churning process known as convection. \nConvection as a process was first deduced by the eccentric Count von Rumford at the end of \nthe eighteenth century. Sixty years later an English vicar named Osmond Fisher presciently \nsuggested that the Earth\u2019s interior might well be fluid enough for the contents to move about, \nbut that idea took a very long time to gain support. \n    In about 1970, when geophysicists realized just how much turmoil was going on down \nthere, it came as a considerable shock. As Shawna Vogel put it in the book Naked Earth: The \nNew Geophysics: \u201cIt was as if scientists had spent decades figuring out the layers of the \nEarth\u2019s atmosphere\u2014troposphere, stratosphere, and so forth\u2014and then had suddenly found \nout about wind.\u201d \n    How deep the convection process goes has been a matter of controversy ever since. Some \nsay it begins four hundred miles down, others two thousand miles below us. The problem, as \nDonald Trefil has observed, is that \u201cthere are two sets of data, from two different disciplines, \nthat cannot be reconciled.\u201d Geochemists say that certain elements on Earth\u2019s surface cannot \nhave come from the upper mantle, but must have come from deeper within the Earth. \nTherefore the materials in the upper and lower mantle must at least occasionally mix. \nSeismologists insist that there is no evidence to support such a thesis. \n    So all that can be said is that at some slightly indeterminate point as we head toward the \ncenter of Earth we leave the asthenosphere and plunge into pure mantle. Considering that it \naccounts for 82 percent of the Earth\u2019s volume and 65 percent of its mass, the mantle doesn\u2019t \nattract a great deal of attention, largely because the things that interest Earth scientists and \ngeneral readers alike happen either deeper down (as with magnetism) or nearer the surface (as \nwith earthquakes). We know that to a depth of about a hundred miles the mantle consists \npredominantly of a type of rock known as peridotite, but what fills the space beyond is \nuncertain. According to a Nature report, it seems not to be peridotite. More than this we do \nnot know.Beneath the mantle are the two cores\u2014a solid inner core and a liquid outer one. Needless to \nsay, our understanding of the nature of these cores is indirect, but scientists can make some \nreasonable assumptions. They know that the pressures at the center of the Earth are \nsufficiently high\u2014something over three million times those found at the surface\u2014to turn any \nrock there solid. They also know from Earth\u2019s history (among other clues) that the inner core \nis very good at retaining its heat. Although it is little more than a guess, it is thought that in \nover four billion years the temperature at the core has fallen by no more than 200\u00b0F. No one \nknows exactly how hot the Earth\u2019s core is, but estimates range from something over 7,000\u00b0F \nto 13,000\u00b0F\u2014about as hot as the surface of the Sun. \n    The outer core is in many ways even less well understood, though everyone is in agreement \nthat it is fluid and that it is the seat of magnetism. The theory was put forward by E. C. \nBullard of Cambridge University in 1949 that this fluid part of the Earth\u2019s core revolves in a \nway that makes it, in effect, an electrical motor, creating the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The \nassumption is that the convecting fluids in the Earth act somehow like the currents in wires. \nExactly what happens isn\u2019t known, but it is felt pretty certain that it is connected with the core \nspinning and with its being liquid. Bodies that don\u2019t have a liquid core\u2014the Moon and Mars, \nfor instance\u2014don\u2019t have magnetism. \n    We know that Earth\u2019s magnetic field changes in power from time to time: during the age of \nthe dinosaurs, it was up to three times as strong as now. We also know that it reverses itself \nevery 500,000 years or so on average, though that average hides a huge degree of \nunpredictability. The last reversal was about 750,000 years ago. Sometimes it stays put for \nmillions of years\u201437 million years appears to be the longest stretch\u2014and at other times it has \nreversed after as little as 20,000 years. Altogether in the last 100 million years it has reversed \nitself about two hundred times, and we don\u2019t have any real idea why. It has been called \u201cthe \ngreatest unanswered question in the geological sciences.\u201d \n    We may be going through a reversal now. The Earth\u2019s magnetic field has diminished by \nperhaps as much as 6 percent in the last century alone. Any diminution in magnetism is likely \nto be bad news, because magnetism, apart from holding notes to refrigerators and keeping our \ncompasses pointing the right way, plays a vital role in keeping us alive. Space is full of \ndangerous cosmic rays that in the absence of magnetic protection would tear through our \nbodies, leaving much of our DNA in useless tatters. When the magnetic field is working, \nthese rays are safely herded away from the Earth\u2019s surface and into two zones in near space \ncalled the Van Allen belts. They also interact with particles in the upper atmosphere to create \nthe bewitching veils of light known as the auroras. \n    A big part of the reason for our ignorance, interestingly enough, is that traditionally there \nhas been little effort to coordinate what\u2019s happening on top of the Earth with what\u2019s going on \ninside. According to Shawna Vogel: \u201cGeologists and geophysicists rarely go to the same \nmeetings or collaborate on the same problems.\u201d \n    Perhaps nothing better demonstrates our inadequate grasp of the dynamics of the Earth\u2019s \ninterior than how badly we are caught out when it acts up, and it would be hard to come up \nwith a more salutary reminder of the limitations of our understanding than the eruption of \nMount St. Helens in Washington in 1980. \n    At that time, the lower forty-eight United States had not seen a volcanic eruption for over \nsixty-five years. Therefore the government volcanologists called in to monitor and forecast St.Helens\u2019s behavior primarily had seen only Hawaiian volcanoes in action, and they, it turned \nout, were not the same thing at all. \n    St. Helens started its ominous rumblings on March 20. Within a week it was erupting \nmagma, albeit in modest amounts, up to a hundred times a day, and being constantly shaken \nwith earthquakes. People were evacuated to what was assumed to be a safe distance of eight \nmiles. As the mountain\u2019s rumblings grew St. Helens became a tourist attraction for the world. \nNewspapers gave daily reports on the best places to get a view. Television crews repeatedly \nflew in helicopters to the summit, and people were even seen climbing over the mountain. On \none day, more than seventy copters and light aircraft circled the summit. But as the days \npassed and the rumblings failed to develop into anything dramatic, people grew restless, and \nthe view became general that the volcano wasn\u2019t going to blow after all. \n    On April 19 the northern flank of the mountain began to bulge conspicuously. Remarkably, \nno one in a position of responsibility saw that this strongly signaled a lateral blast. The \nseismologists resolutely based their conclusions on the behavior of Hawaiian volcanoes, \nwhich don\u2019t blow out sideways. Almost the only person who believed that something really \nbad might happen was Jack Hyde, a geology professor at a community college in Tacoma. He \npointed out that St. Helens didn\u2019t have an open vent, as Hawaiian volcanoes have, so any \npressure building up inside was bound to be released dramatically and probably \ncatastrophically. However, Hyde was not part of the official team and his observations \nattracted little notice. \n    We all know what happened next. At 8:32 A.M. on a Sunday morning, May 18, the north \nside of the volcano collapsed, sending an enormous avalanche of dirt and rock rushing down \nthe mountain slope at 150 miles an hour. It was the biggest landslide in human history and \ncarried enough material to bury the whole of Manhattan to a depth of four hundred feet. A \nminute later, its flank severely weakened, St. Helens exploded with the force of five hundred \nHiroshima-sized atomic bombs, shooting out a murderous hot cloud at up to 650 miles an \nhour\u2014much too fast, clearly, for anyone nearby to outrace. Many people who were thought to \nbe in safe areas, often far out of sight of the volcano, were overtaken. Fifty-seven people were \nkilled. Twenty-three of the bodies were never found. The toll would have been much higher \nexcept that it was a Sunday. Had it been a weekday many lumber workers would have been \nworking within the death zone. As it was, people were killed eighteen miles away. \n    The luckiest person on that day was a graduate student named Harry Glicken. He had been \nmanning an observation post 5.7 miles from the mountain, but he had a college placement \ninterview on May 18 in California, and so had left the site the day before the eruption. His \nplace was taken by David Johnston. Johnston was the first to report the volcano exploding; \nmoments later he was dead. His body was never found. Glicken\u2019s luck, alas, was temporary. \nEleven years later he was one of forty-three scientists and journalists fatally caught up in a \nlethal outpouring of superheated ash, gases, and molten rock\u2014what is known as a pyroclastic \nflow\u2014at Mount Unzen in Japan when yet another volcano was catastrophically misread. \n    Volcanologists may or may not be the worst scientists in the world at making predictions, \nbut they are without question the worst in the world at realizing how bad their predictions are. \nLess than two years after the Unzen catastrophe another group of volcano watchers, led by \nStanley Williams of the University of Arizona, descended into the rim of an active volcano \ncalled Galeras in Colombia. Despite the deaths of recent years, only two of the sixteen \nmembers of Williams\u2019s party wore safety helmets or other protective gear. The volcanoerupted, killing six of the scientists, along with three tourists who had followed them, and \nseriously injuring several others, including Williams himself. \n    In an extraordinarily unself-critical book called Surviving Galeras, Williams said he could \n\u201conly shake my head in wonder\u201d when he learned afterward that his colleagues in the world \nof volcanology had suggested that he had overlooked or disregarded important seismic signals \nand behaved recklessly. \u201cHow easy it is to snipe after the fact, to apply the knowledge we \nhave now to the events of 1993,\u201d he wrote. He was guilty of nothing worse, he believed, than \nunlucky timing when Galeras \u201cbehaved capriciously, as natural forces are wont to do. I was \nfooled, and for that I will take responsibility. But I do not feel guilty about the deaths of my \ncolleagues. There is no guilt. There was only an eruption.\u201d \n    But to return to Washington. Mount St. Helens lost thirteen hundred feet of peak, and 230 \nsquare miles of forest were devastated. Enough trees to build 150,000 homes (or 300,000 in \nsome reports) were blown away. The damage was placed at $2.7 billion. A giant column of \nsmoke and ash rose to a height of sixty thousand feet in less than ten minutes. An airliner \nsome thirty miles away reported being pelted with rocks. \n    Ninety minutes after the blast, ash began to rain down on Yakima, Washington, a \ncommunity of fifty thousand people about eighty miles away. As you would expect, the ash \nturned day to night and got into everything, clogging motors, generators, and electrical \nswitching equipment, choking pedestrians, blocking filtration systems, and generally bringing \nthings to a halt. The airport shut down and highways in and out of the city were closed. \n    All this was happening, you will note, just downwind of a volcano that had been rumbling \nmenacingly for two months. Yet Yakima had no volcano emergency procedures. The city\u2019s \nemergency broadcast system, which was supposed to swing into action during a crisis, did not \ngo on the air because \u201cthe Sunday-morning staff did not know how to operate the equipment.\u201d \nFor three days, Yakima was paralyzed and cut off from the world, its airport closed, its \napproach roads impassable. Altogether the city received just five-eighths of an inch of ash \nafter the eruption of Mount St. Helens. Now bear that in mind, please, as we consider what a \nYellowstone blast would do.", "15": "15    DANGEROUS BEAUTY \n \n \n \nIN THE 1960s, while studying the volcanic history of Yellowstone National Park, Bob \nChristiansen of the United States Geological Survey became puzzled about something that, \noddly, had not troubled anyone before: he couldn\u2019t find the park\u2019s volcano. It had been known \nfor a long time that Yellowstone was volcanic in nature\u2014that\u2019s what accounted for all its \ngeysers and other steamy features\u2014and the one thing about volcanoes is that they are \ngenerally pretty conspicuous. But Christiansen couldn\u2019t find the Yellowstone volcano \nanywhere. In particular what he couldn\u2019t find was a structure known as a caldera. \n    Most of us, when we think of volcanoes, think of the classic cone shapes of a Fuji or \nKilimanjaro, which are created when erupting magma accumulates in a symmetrical mound. \nThese can form remarkably quickly. In 1943, at Par\u00edcutin in Mexico, a farmer was startled to \nsee smoke rising from a patch on his land. In one week he was the bemused owner of a cone \nfive hundred feet high. Within two years it had topped out at almost fourteen hundred feet and \nwas more than half a mile across. Altogether there are some ten thousand of these intrusively \nvisible volcanoes on Earth, all but a few hundred of them extinct. But there is a second, less \ncelebrated type of volcano that doesn\u2019t involve mountain building. These are volcanoes so \nexplosive that they burst open in a single mighty rupture, leaving behind a vast subsided pit, \nthe caldera (from a Latin word for cauldron). Yellowstone obviously was of this second type, \nbut Christiansen couldn\u2019t find the caldera anywhere. \n    By coincidence just at this time NASA decided to test some new high-altitude cameras by \ntaking photographs of Yellowstone, copies of which some thoughtful official passed on to the \npark authorities on the assumption that they might make a nice blow-up for one of the \nvisitors\u2019 centers. As soon as Christiansen saw the photos he realized why he had failed to spot \nthe caldera: virtually the whole park\u20142.2 million acres\u2014was caldera. The explosion had left \na crater more than forty miles across\u2014much too huge to be perceived from anywhere at \nground level. At some time in the past Yellowstone must have blown up with a violence far \nbeyond the scale of anything known to humans. \n    Yellowstone, it turns out, is a supervolcano. It sits on top of an enormous hot spot, a \nreservoir of molten rock that rises from at least 125 miles down in the Earth. The heat from \nthe hot spot is what powers all of Yellowstone\u2019s vents, geysers, hot springs, and popping mud \npots. Beneath the surface is a magma chamber that is about forty-five miles across\u2014roughly \nthe same dimensions as the park\u2014and about eight miles thick at its thickest point. Imagine a \npile of TNT about the size of Rhode Island and reaching eight miles into the sky, to about the \nheight of the highest cirrus clouds, and you have some idea of what visitors to Yellowstone \nare shuffling around on top of. The pressure that such a pool of magma exerts on the crust \nabove has lifted Yellowstone and about three hundred miles of surrounding territory about \n1,700 feet higher than they would otherwise be. If it blew, the cataclysm is pretty well beyond \nimagining. According to Professor Bill McGuire of University College London, \u201cyou \nwouldn\u2019t be able to get within a thousand kilometers of it\u201d while it was erupting. The \nconsequences that followed would be even worse.Superplumes of the type on which Yellowstone sits are rather like martini glasses\u2014thin on \nthe way up, but spreading out as they near the surface to create vast bowls of unstable magma. \nSome of these bowls can be up to 1,200 miles across. According to theories, they don\u2019t \nalways erupt explosively but sometimes burst forth in a vast, continuous outpouring\u2014a \nflood\u2014of molten rock, such as with the Deccan Traps in India sixty-five million years ago. \n(Trap in this context comes from a Swedish word for a type of lava; Deccan is simply an \narea.) These covered an area of 200,000 square miles and probably contributed to the demise \nof the dinosaurs\u2014they certainly didn\u2019t help\u2014with their noxious outgassings. Superplumes \nmay also be responsible for the rifts that cause continents to break up. \n    Such plumes are not all that rare. There are about thirty active ones on the Earth at the \nmoment, and they are responsible for many of the world\u2019s best-known islands and island \nchains\u2014Iceland, Hawaii, the Azores, Canaries, and Gal\u00e1pagos archipelagos, little Pitcairn in \nthe middle of the South Pacific, and many others\u2014but apart from Yellowstone they are all \noceanic. No one has the faintest idea how or why Yellowstone\u2019s ended up beneath a \ncontinental plate. Only two things are certain: that the crust at Yellowstone is thin and that the \nworld beneath it is hot. But whether the crust is thin because of the hot spot or whether the hot \nspot is there because the crust is thin is a matter of heated (as it were) debate. The continental \nnature of the crust makes a huge difference to its eruptions. Where the other supervolcanoes \ntend to bubble away steadily and in a comparatively benign fashion, Yellowstone blows \nexplosively. It doesn\u2019t happen often, but when it does you want to stand well back. \n    Since its first known eruption 16.5 million years ago, it has blown up about a hundred \ntimes, but the most recent three eruptions are the ones that get written about. The last eruption \nwas a thousand times greater than that of Mount St. Helens; the one before that was 280 times \nbigger, and the one before was so big that nobody knows exactly how big it was. It was at \nleast twenty-five hundred times greater than St. Helens, but perhaps eight thousand times \nmore monstrous. \n    We have absolutely nothing to compare it to. The biggest blast in recent times was that of \nKrakatau in Indonesia in August 1883, which made a bang that reverberated around the world \nfor nine days, and made water slosh as far away as the English Channel. But if you imagine \nthe volume of ejected material from Krakatau as being about the size of a golf ball, then the \nbiggest of the Yellowstone blasts would be the size of a sphere you could just about hide \nbehind. On this scale, Mount St. Helens\u2019s would be no more than a pea. \n    The Yellowstone eruption of two million years ago put out enough ash to bury New York \nState to a depth of sixty-seven feet or California to a depth of twenty. This was the ash that \nmade Mike Voorhies\u2019s fossil beds in eastern Nebraska. That blast occurred in what is now \nIdaho, but over millions of years, at a rate of about one inch a year, the Earth\u2019s crust has \ntraveled over it, so that today it is directly under northwest Wyoming. (The hot spot itself \nstays in one place, like an acetylene torch aimed at a ceiling.) In its wake it leaves the sort of \nrich volcanic plains that are ideal for growing potatoes, as Idaho\u2019s farmers long ago \ndiscovered. In another two million years, geologists like to joke, Yellowstone will be \nproducing French fries for McDonald\u2019s, and the people of Billings, Montana, will be stepping \naround geysers. \n    The ash fall from the last Yellowstone eruption covered all or parts of nineteen western \nstates (plus parts of Canada and Mexico)\u2014nearly the whole of the United States west of the \nMississippi. This, bear in mind, is the breadbasket of America, an area that produces roughly \nhalf the world\u2019s cereals. And ash, it is worth remembering, is not like a big snowfall that willmelt in the spring. If you wanted to grow crops again, you would have to find some place to \nput all the ash. It took thousands of workers eight months to clear 1.8 billion tons of debris \nfrom the sixteen acres of the World Trade Center site in New York. Imagine what it would \ntake to clear Kansas. \n    And that\u2019s not even to consider the climatic consequences. The last supervolcano eruption \non Earth was at Toba, in northern Sumatra, seventy-four thousand years ago. No one knows \nquite how big it was other than that it was a whopper. Greenland ice cores show that the Toba \nblast was followed by at least six years of \u201cvolcanic winter\u201d and goodness knows how many \npoor growing seasons after that. The event, it is thought, may have carried humans right to the \nbrink of extinction, reducing the global population to no more than a few thousand \nindividuals. That means that all modern humans arose from a very small population base, \nwhich would explain our lack of genetic diversity. At all events, there is some evidence to \nsuggest that for the next twenty thousand years the total number of people on Earth was never \nmore than a few thousand at any time. That is, needless to say, a long time to recover from a \nsingle volcanic blast. \n    All this was hypothetically interesting until 1973, when an odd occurrence made it \nsuddenly momentous: water in Yellowstone Lake, in the heart of the park, began to run over \nthe banks at the lake\u2019s southern end, flooding a meadow, while at the opposite end of the lake \nthe water mysteriously flowed away. Geologists did a hasty survey and discovered that a large \narea of the park had developed an ominous bulge. This was lifting up one end of the lake and \ncausing the water to run out at the other, as would happen if you lifted one side of a child\u2019s \nwading pool. By 1984, the whole central region of the park\u2014several dozen square miles\u2014\nwas more than three feet higher than it had been in 1924, when the park was last formally \nsurveyed. Then in 1985, the whole of the central part of the park subsided by eight inches. It \nnow seems to be swelling again. \n    The geologists realized that only one thing could cause this\u2014a restless magma chamber. \nYellowstone wasn\u2019t the site of an ancient supervolcano; it was the site of an active one. It was \nalso at about this time that they were able to work out that the cycle of Yellowstone\u2019s \neruptions averaged one massive blow every 600,000 years. The last one, interestingly enough, \nwas 630,000 years ago. Yellowstone, it appears, is due. \n  \n    \u201cIt may not feel like it, but you\u2019re standing on the largest active volcano in the world,\u201d Paul \nDoss, Yellowstone National Park geologist, told me soon after climbing off an enormous \nHarley-Davidson motorcycle and shaking hands when we met at the park headquarters at \nMammoth Hot Springs early on a lovely morning in June. A native of Indiana, Doss is an \namiable, soft-spoken, extremely thoughtful man who looks nothing like a National Park \nService employee. He has a graying beard and hair tied back in a long ponytail. A small \nsapphire stud graces one ear. A slight paunch strains against his crisp Park Service uniform. \nHe looks more like a blues musician than a government employee. In fact, he is a blues \nmusician (harmonica). But he sure knows and loves geology. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got the best place in \nthe world to do it,\u201d he says as we set off in a bouncy, battered four-wheel-drive vehicle in the \ngeneral direction of Old Faithful. He has agreed to let me accompany him for a day as he goes \nabout doing whatever it is a park geologist does. The first assignment today is to give an \nintroductory talk to a new crop of tour guides.Yellowstone, I hardly need point out, is sensationally beautiful, with plump, stately \nmountains, bison-specked meadows, tumbling streams, a sky-blue lake, wildlife beyond \ncounting. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t get any better than this if you\u2019re a geologist,\u201d Doss says. \u201cYou\u2019ve \ngot rocks up at Beartooth Gap that are nearly three billion years old\u2014three-quarters of the \nway back to Earth\u2019s beginning\u2014and then you\u2019ve got mineral springs here\u201d\u2014he points at the \nsulfurous hot springs from which Mammoth takes its title\u2014\u201cwhere you can see rocks as they \nare being born. And in between there\u2019s everything you could possibly imagine. I\u2019ve never \nbeen any place where geology is more evident\u2014or prettier.\u201d \n    \u201cSo you like it?\u201d I say. \n    \u201cOh, no, I love it,\u201d he answers with profound sincerity. \u201cI mean I really love it here. The \nwinters are tough and the pay\u2019s not too hot, but when it\u2019s good, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d \n    He interrupted himself to point out a distant gap in a range of mountains to the west, which \nhad just come into view over a rise. The mountains, he told me, were known as the Gallatins. \n\u201cThat gap is sixty or maybe seventy miles across. For a long time nobody could understand \nwhy that gap was there, and then Bob Christiansen realized that it had to be because the \nmountains were just blown away. When you\u2019ve got sixty miles of mountains just obliterated, \nyou know you\u2019re dealing with something pretty potent. It took Christiansen six years to figure \nit all out.\u201d \n    I asked him what caused Yellowstone to blow when it did. \n    \u201cDon\u2019t know. Nobody knows. Volcanoes are strange things. We really don\u2019t understand \nthem at all. Vesuvius, in Italy, was active for three hundred years until an eruption in 1944 \nand then it just stopped. It\u2019s been silent ever since. Some volcanologists think that it is \nrecharging in a big way, which is a little worrying because two million people live on or \naround it. But nobody knows.\u201d \n    \u201cAnd how much warning would you get if Yellowstone was going to go?\u201d \n    He shrugged. \u201cNobody was around the last time it blew, so nobody knows what the \nwarning signs are. Probably you would have swarms of earthquakes and some surface uplift \nand possibly some changes in the patterns of behavior of the geysers and steam vents, but \nnobody really knows.\u201d \n    \u201cSo it could just blow without warning?\u201d \n    He nodded thoughtfully. The trouble, he explained, is that nearly all the things that would \nconstitute warning signs already exist in some measure at Yellowstone. \u201cEarthquakes are \ngenerally a precursor of volcanic eruptions, but the park already has lots of earthquakes\u2014\n1,260 of them last year. Most of them are too small to be felt, but they are earthquakes \nnonetheless.\u201d \n    A change in the pattern of geyser eruptions might also be taken as a clue, he said, but these \ntoo vary unpredictably. Once the most famous geyser in the park was Excelsior Geyser. It \nused to erupt regularly and spectacularly to heights of three hundred feet, but in 1888 it just \nstopped. Then in 1985 it erupted again, though only to a height of eighty feet. Steamboat \nGeyser is the biggest geyser in the world when it blows, shooting water four hundred feet into \nthe air, but the intervals between its eruptions have ranged from as little as four days to almostfifty years. \u201cIf it blew today and again next week, that wouldn\u2019t tell us anything at all about \nwhat it might do the following week or the week after or twenty years from now,\u201d Doss says. \n\u201cThe whole park is so volatile that it\u2019s essentially impossible to draw conclusions from almost \nanything that happens.\u201d \n    Evacuating Yellowstone would never be easy. The park gets some three million visitors a \nyear, mostly in the three peak months of summer. The park\u2019s roads are comparatively few and \nthey are kept intentionally narrow, partly to slow traffic, partly to preserve an air of \npicturesqueness, and partly because of topographical constraints. At the height of summer, it \ncan easily take half a day to cross the park and hours to get anywhere within it. \u201cWhenever \npeople see animals, they just stop, wherever they are,\u201d Doss says. \u201cWe get bear jams. We get \nbison jams. We get wolf jams.\u201d \n  \n    In the autumn of 2000, representatives from the U.S. Geological Survey and National Park \nService, along with some academics, met and formed something called the Yellowstone \nVolcanic Observatory. Four such bodies were in existence already\u2014in Hawaii, California, \nAlaska, and Washington\u2014but oddly none in the largest volcanic zone in the world. The YVO \nis not actually a thing, but more an idea\u2014an agreement to coordinate efforts at studying and \nanalyzing the park\u2019s diverse geology. One of their first tasks, Doss told me, was to draw up an \n\u201cearthquake and volcano hazards plan\u201d\u2014a plan of action in the event of a crisis. \n    \u201cThere isn\u2019t one already?\u201d I said. \n    \u201cNo. Afraid not. But there will be soon.\u201d \n    \u201cIsn\u2019t that just a little tardy?\u201d \n    He smiled. \u201cWell, let\u2019s just say that it\u2019s not any too soon.\u201d \n    Once it is in place, the idea is that three people\u2014Christiansen in Menlo Park, California, \nProfessor Robert B. Smith at the University of Utah, and Doss in the park\u2014would assess the \ndegree of danger of any potential cataclysm and advise the park superintendent. The \nsuperintendent would take the decision whether to evacuate the park. As for surrounding \nareas, there are no plans. If Yellowstone were going to blow in a really big way, you would be \non your own once you left the park gates. \n    Of course it may be tens of thousands of years before that day comes. Doss thinks such a \nday may not come at all. \u201cJust because there was a pattern in the past doesn\u2019t mean that it still \nholds true,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is some evidence to suggest that the pattern may be a series of \ncatastrophic explosions, then a long period of quiet. We may be in that now. The evidence \nnow is that most of the magma chamber is cooling and crystallizing. It is releasing its \nvolatiles; you need to trap volatiles for an explosive eruption.\u201d \n    In the meantime there are plenty of other dangers in and around Yellowstone, as was made \ndevastatingly evident on the night of August 17, 1959, at a place called Hebgen Lake just \noutside the park. At twenty minutes to midnight on that date, Hebgen Lake suffered a \ncatastrophic quake. It was magnitude 7.5, not vast as earthquakes go, but so abrupt and \nwrenching that it collapsed an entire mountainside. It was the height of the summer season, \nthough fortunately not so many people went to Yellowstone in those days as now. Eightymillion tons of rock, moving at more than one hundred miles an hour, just fell off the \nmountain, traveling with such force and momentum that the leading edge of the landslide ran \nfour hundred feet up a mountain on the other side of the valley. Along its path lay part of the \nRock Creek Campground. Twenty-eight campers were killed, nineteen of them buried too \ndeep ever to be found again. The devastation was swift but heartbreakingly fickle. Three \nbrothers, sleeping in one tent, were spared. Their parents, sleeping in another tent beside \nthem, were swept away and never seen again. \n    \u201cA big earthquake\u2014and I mean big\u2014will happen sometime,\u201d Doss told me. \u201cYou can \ncount on that. This is a big fault zone for earthquakes.\u201d \n    Despite the Hebgen Lake quake and the other known risks, Yellowstone didn\u2019t get \npermanent seismometers until the 1970s. \n  \n    If you needed a way to appreciate the grandeur and inexorable nature of geologic processes, \nyou could do worse than to consider the Tetons, the sumptuously jagged range that stands just \nto the south of Yellowstone National Park. Nine million years ago, the Tetons didn\u2019t exist. \nThe land around Jackson Hole was just a high grassy plain. But then a forty-mile-long fault \nopened within the Earth, and since then, about once every nine hundred years, the Tetons \nexperience a really big earthquake, enough to jerk them another six feet higher. It is these \nrepeated jerks over eons that have raised them to their present majestic heights of seven \nthousand feet. \n    That nine hundred years is an average\u2014and a somewhat misleading one. According to \nRobert B. Smith and Lee J. Siegel in Windows into the Earth , a geological history of the \nregion, the last major Teton quake was somewhere between about five and seven thousand \nyears ago. The Tetons, in short, are about the most overdue earthquake zone on the planet. \n    Hydrothermal explosions are also a significant risk. They can happen anytime, pretty much \nanywhere, and without any predictability. \u201cYou know, by design we funnel visitors into \nthermal basins,\u201d Doss told me after we had watched Old Faithful blow. \u201cIt\u2019s what they come \nto see. Did you know there are more geysers and hot springs at Yellowstone than in all the \nrest of the world combined?\u201d \n    \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d \n    He nodded. \u201cTen thousand of them, and nobody knows when a new vent might open.\u201d We \ndrove to a place called Duck Lake, a body of water a couple of hundred yards across. \u201cIt looks \ncompletely innocuous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a big pond. But this big hole didn\u2019t used to be here. \nAt some time in the last fifteen thousand years this blew in a really big way. You\u2019d have had \nseveral tens of millions of tons of earth and rock and superheated water blowing out at \nhypersonic speeds. You can imagine what it would be like if this happened under, say, the \nparking lot at Old Faithful or one of the visitors\u2019 centers.\u201d He made an unhappy face. \n    \u201cWould there be any warning?\u201d \n    \u201cProbably not. The last significant explosion in the park was at a place called Pork Chop \nGeyser in 1989. That left a crater about five meters across\u2014not huge by any means, but big \nenough if you happened to be standing there at the time. Fortunately, nobody was around sonobody was hurt, but that happened without warning. In the very ancient past there have been \nexplosions that have made holes a mile across. And nobody can tell you where or when that \nmight happen again. You just have to hope that you\u2019re not standing there when it does.\u201d \n    Big rockfalls are also a danger. There was a big one at Gardiner Canyon in 1999, but again \nfortunately no one was hurt. Late in the afternoon, Doss and I stopped at a place where there \nwas a rock overhang poised above a busy park road. Cracks were clearly visible. \u201cIt could go \nat any time,\u201d Doss said thoughtfully. \n    \u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d I said. There wasn\u2019t a moment when there weren\u2019t two cars passing \nbeneath it, all filled with, in the most literal sense, happy campers. \n    \u201cOh, it\u2019s not likely,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m just saying it could. Equally it could stay like that for \ndecades. There\u2019s just no telling. People have to accept that there is risk in coming here. That\u2019s \nall there is to it.\u201d \n    As we walked back to his vehicle to head back to Mammoth Hot Springs, Doss added: \u201cBut \nthe thing is, most of the time bad things don\u2019t happen. Rocks don\u2019t fall. Earthquakes don\u2019t \noccur. New vents don\u2019t suddenly open up. For all the instability, it\u2019s mostly remarkably and \namazingly tranquil.\u201d \n    \u201cLike Earth itself,\u201d I remarked. \n    \u201cPrecisely,\u201d he agreed. \n  \n    The risks at Yellowstone apply to park employees as much as to visitors. Doss got a \nhorrific sense of that in his first week on the job five years earlier. Late one night, three young \nsummer employees engaged in an illicit activity known as \u201chot-potting\u201d\u2014swimming or \nbasking in warm pools. Though the park, for obvious reasons, doesn\u2019t publicize it, not all the \npools in Yellowstone are dangerously hot. Some are extremely agreeable to lie in, and it was \nthe habit of some of the summer employees to have a dip late at night even though it was \nagainst the rules to do so. Foolishly the threesome had failed to take a flashlight, which was \nextremely dangerous because much of the soil around the warm pools is crusty and thin and \none can easily fall through into a scalding vent below. In any case, as they made their way \nback to their dorm, they came across a stream that they had had to leap over earlier. They \nbacked up a few paces, linked arms and, on the count of three, took a running jump. In fact, it \nwasn\u2019t the stream at all. It was a boiling pool. In the dark they had lost their bearings. None of \nthe three survived. \n    I thought about this the next morning as I made a brief call, on my way out of the park, at a \nplace called Emerald Pool, in the Upper Geyser Basin. Doss hadn\u2019t had time to take me there \nthe day before, but I thought I ought at least to have a look at it, for Emerald Pool is a historic \nsite. \n    In 1965, a husband-and-wife team of biologists named Thomas and Louise Brock, while on \na summer study trip, had done a crazy thing. They had scooped up some of the yellowy-\nbrown scum that rimmed the pool and examined it for life. To their, and eventually the wider \nworld\u2019s, deep surprise, it was full of living microbes. They had found the world\u2019s first \nextremophiles\u2014organisms that could live in water that had previously been assumed to bemuch too hot or acid or choked with sulfur to bear life. Emerald Pool, remarkably, was all \nthese things, yet at least two types of living things, Sulpholobus acidocaldarius and \nThermophilus aquaticus as they became known, found it congenial. It had always been \nsupposed that nothing could survive above temperatures of 50\u00b0C (122\u00b0F), but here were \norganisms basking in rank, acidic waters nearly twice that hot. \n    For almost twenty years, one of the Brocks\u2019 two new bacteria, Thermophilus aquaticus, \nremained a laboratory curiosity until a scientist in California named Kary B. Mullis realized \nthat heat-resistant enzymes within it could be used to create a bit of chemical wizardry known \nas a polymerase chain reaction, which allows scientists to generate lots of DNA from very \nsmall amounts\u2014as little as a single molecule in ideal conditions. It\u2019s a kind of genetic \nphotocopying, and it became the basis for all subsequent genetic science, from academic \nstudies to police forensic work. It won Mullis the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1993. \n    Meanwhile, \nscientists \nwere \nfinding \neven \nhardier \nmicrobes, \nnow \nknown \nas \nhyperthermophiles, which demand temperatures of 80\u00b0C (176\u00b0F) or more. The warmest \norganism found so far, according to Frances Ashcroft in Life at the Extremes, is Pyrolobus \nfumarii, which dwells in the walls of ocean vents where the temperature can reach 113\u00b0C \n(235.4\u00b0F). The upper limit for life is thought to be about 120\u00b0C (248\u00b0F), though no one \nactually knows. At all events, the Brocks\u2019 findings completely changed our perception of the \nliving world. As NASA scientist Jay Bergstralh has put it: \u201cWherever we go on Earth\u2014even \ninto what\u2019s seemed like the most hostile possible environments for life\u2014as long as there is \nliquid water and some source of chemical energy we find life.\u201d \n    Life, it turns out, is infinitely more clever and adaptable than anyone had ever supposed. \nThis is a very good thing, for as we are about to see, we live in a world that doesn\u2019t altogether \nseem to want us here.PART V   LIFE ITSELF \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe more I examine the universe  \n \n \n \nand study the details of its architecture,  \n \n \n \nthe more evidence I find that the  \n \n \n \nuniverse in some sense must have  \n \n \n \nknown we were coming. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-Freeman Dyson", "16": "16    LONELY PLANET \n \n \n \n \nIT ISN\u2019T EASY being an organism. In the whole universe, as far as we yet know, there is \nonly one place, an inconspicuous outpost of the Milky Way called Earth, that will sustain you, \nand even it can be pretty grudging. \n    From the bottom of the deepest ocean trench to the top of the highest mountain, the zone \nthat covers nearly the whole of known life, is only something over a dozen miles\u2014not much \nwhen set against the roominess of the cosmos at large. \n    For humans it is even worse because we happen to belong to the portion of living things \nthat took the rash but venturesome decision 400 million years ago to crawl out of the seas and \nbecome land based and oxygen breathing. In consequence, no less than 99.5 percent of the \nworld\u2019s habitable space by volume, according to one estimate, is fundamentally\u2014in practical \nterms completely\u2014off-limits to us. \n    It isn\u2019t simply that we can\u2019t breathe in water, but that we couldn\u2019t bear the pressures. \nBecause water is about 1,300 times heavier than air, pressures rise swiftly as you descend\u2014\nby the equivalent of one atmosphere for every ten meters (thirty-three feet) of depth. On land, \nif you rose to the top of a five-hundred-foot eminence\u2014Cologne Cathedral or the Washington \nMonument, say\u2014the change in pressure would be so slight as to be indiscernible. At the same \ndepth underwater, however, your veins would collapse and your lungs would compress to the \napproximate dimensions of a Coke can. Amazingly, people do voluntarily dive to such depths, \nwithout breathing apparatus, for the fun of it in a sport known as free diving. Apparently the \nexperience of having your internal organs rudely deformed is thought exhilarating (though not \npresumably as exhilarating as having them return to their former dimensions upon \nresurfacing). To reach such depths, however, divers must be dragged down, and quite briskly, \nby weights. Without assistance, the deepest anyone has gone and lived to talk about it \nafterward was an Italian named Umberto Pelizzari, who in 1992 dove to a depth of 236 feet, \nlingered for a nanosecond, and then shot back to the surface. In terrestrial terms, 236 feet is \njust slightly over the length of one New York City block. So even in our most exuberant \nstunts we can hardly claim to be masters of the abyss. \n    Other organisms do of course manage to deal with the pressures at depth, though quite how \nsome of them do so is a mystery. The deepest point in the ocean is the Mariana Trench in the \nPacific. There, some seven miles down, the pressures rise to over sixteen thousand pounds per \nsquare inch. We have managed once, briefly, to send humans to that depth in a sturdy diving \nvessel, yet it is home to colonies of amphipods, a type of crustacean similar to shrimp but \ntransparent, which survive without any protection at all. Most oceans are of course muchshallower, but even at the average ocean depth of two and a half miles the pressure is \nequivalent to being squashed beneath a stack of fourteen loaded cement trucks. \n    Nearly everyone, including the authors of some popular books on oceanography, assumes \nthat the human body would crumple under the immense pressures of the deep ocean. In fact, \nthis appears not to be the case. Because we are made largely of water ourselves, and water is \n\u201cvirtually incompressible,\u201d in the words of Frances Ashcroft of Oxford University, \u201cthe body \nremains at the same pressure as the surrounding water, and is not crushed at depth.\u201d It is the \ngases inside your body, particularly in the lungs, that cause the trouble. These do compress, \nthough at what point the compression becomes fatal is not known. Until quite recently it was \nthought that anyone diving to one hundred meters or so would die painfully as his or her lungs \nimploded or chest wall collapsed, but the free divers have repeatedly proved otherwise. It \nappears, according to Ashcroft, that \u201chumans may be more like whales and dolphins than had \nbeen expected.\u201d \n    Plenty else can go wrong, however. In the days of diving suits\u2014the sort that were \nconnected to the surface by long hoses\u2014divers sometimes experienced a dreaded \nphenomenon known as \u201cthe squeeze.\u201d This occurred when the surface pumps failed, leading \nto a catastrophic loss of pressure in the suit. The air would leave the suit with such violence \nthat the hapless diver would be, all too literally, sucked up into the helmet and hosepipe. \nWhen hauled to the surface, \u201call that is left in the suit are his bones and some rags of flesh,\u201d \nthe biologist J. B. S. Haldane wrote in 1947, adding for the benefit of doubters, \u201cThis has \nhappened.\u201d \n    (Incidentally, the original diving helmet, designed in 1823 by an Englishman named \nCharles Deane, was intended not for diving but for fire-fighting. It was called a \u201csmoke \nhelmet,\u201d but being made of metal it was hot and cumbersome and, as Deane soon discovered, \nfirefighters had no particular eagerness to enter burning structures in any form of attire, but \nmost especially not in something that heated up like a kettle and made them clumsy into the \nbargain. In an attempt to save his investment, Deane tried it underwater and found it was ideal \nfor salvage work.) \n    The real terror of the deep, however, is the bends\u2014not so much because they are \nunpleasant, though of course they are, as because they are so much more likely. The air we \nbreathe is 80 percent nitrogen. Put the human body under pressure, and that nitrogen is \ntransformed into tiny bubbles that migrate into the blood and tissues. If the pressure is \nchanged too rapidly\u2014as with a too-quick ascent by a diver\u2014the bubbles trapped within the \nbody will begin to fizz in exactly the manner of a freshly opened bottle of champagne, \nclogging tiny blood vessels, depriving cells of oxygen, and causing pain so excruciating that \nsufferers are prone to bend double in agony\u2014hence \u201cthe bends.\u201d \n    The bends have been an occupational hazard for sponge and pearl divers since time \nimmemorial but didn\u2019t attract much attention in the Western world until the nineteenth \ncentury, and then it was among people who didn\u2019t get wet at all (or at least not very wet and \nnot generally much above the ankles). They were caisson workers. Caissons were enclosed \ndry chambers built on riverbeds to facilitate the construction of bridge piers. They were filled \nwith compressed air, and often when the workers emerged after an extended period of \nworking under this artificial pressure they experienced mild symptoms like tingling or itchy \nskin. But an unpredictable few felt more insistent pain in the joints and occasionally collapsed \nin agony, sometimes never to get up again.It was all most puzzling. Sometimes workers would go to bed feeling fine, but wake up \nparalyzed. Sometimes they wouldn\u2019t wake up at all. Ashcroft relates a story concerning the \ndirectors of a new tunnel under the Thames who held a celebratory banquet as the tunnel \nneared completion. To their consternation their champagne failed to fizz when uncorked in \nthe compressed air of the tunnel. However, when at length they emerged into the fresh air of a \nLondon evening, the bubbles sprang instantly to fizziness, memorably enlivening the \ndigestive process. \n    Apart from avoiding high-pressure environments altogether, only two strategies are reliably \nsuccessful against the bends. The first is to suffer only a very short exposure to the changes in \npressure. That is why the free divers I mentioned earlier can descend to depths of five hundred \nfeet without ill effect. They don\u2019t stay under long enough for the nitrogen in their system to \ndissolve into their tissues. The other solution is to ascend by careful stages. This allows the \nlittle bubbles of nitrogen to dissipate harmlessly. \n    A great deal of what we know about surviving at extremes is owed to the extraordinary \nfather-and-son team of John Scott and J. B. S. Haldane. Even by the demanding standards of \nBritish intellectuals, the Haldanes were outstandingly eccentric. The senior Haldane was born \nin 1860 to an aristocratic Scottish family (his brother was Viscount Haldane) but spent most \nof his career in comparative modesty as a professor of physiology at Oxford. He was \nfamously absent-minded. Once after his wife had sent him upstairs to change for a dinner \nparty he failed to return and was discovered asleep in bed in his pajamas. When roused, \nHaldane explained that he had found himself disrobing and assumed it was bedtime. His idea \nof a vacation was to travel to Cornwall to study hookworm in miners. Aldous Huxley, the \nnovelist grandson of T. H. Huxley, who lived with the Haldanes for a time, parodied him, a \ntouch mercilessly, as the scientist Edward Tantamount in the novel Point Counter Point . \n    Haldane\u2019s gift to diving was to work out the rest intervals necessary to manage an ascent \nfrom the depths without getting the bends, but his interests ranged across the whole of \nphysiology, from studying altitude sickness in climbers to the problems of heatstroke in desert \nregions. He had a particular interest in the effects of toxic gases on the human body. To \nunderstand more exactly how carbon monoxide leaks killed miners, he methodically poisoned \nhimself, carefully taking and measuring his own blood samples the while. He quit only when \nhe was on the verge of losing all muscle control and his blood saturation level had reached 56 \npercent\u2014a level, as Trevor Norton notes in his entertaining history of diving, Stars Beneath \nthe Sea, only fractionally removed from nearly certain lethality. \n    Haldane\u2019s son Jack, known to posterity as J.B.S., was a remarkable prodigy who took an \ninterest in his father\u2019s work almost from infancy. At the age of three he was overheard \ndemanding peevishly of his father, \u201cBut is it oxyhaemoglobin or carboxyhaemoglobin?\u201d \nThroughout his youth, the young Haldane helped his father with experiments. By the time he \nwas a teenager, the two often tested gases and gas masks together, taking turns to see how \nlong it took them to pass out. \n    Though J. B. S. Haldane never took a degree in science (he studied classics at Oxford), he \nbecame a brilliant scientist in his own right, mostly in Cambridge. The biologist Peter \nMedawar, who spent his life around mental Olympians, called him \u201cthe cleverest man I ever \nknew.\u201d Huxley likewise parodied the younger Haldane in his novel Antic Hay, but also used \nhis ideas on genetic manipulation of humans as the basis for the plot of Brave New World. \nAmong many other achievements, Haldane played a central role in marrying Darwinianprinciples of evolution to the genetic work of Gregor Mendel to produce what is known to \ngeneticists as the Modern Synthesis. \nPerhaps uniquely among human beings, the younger Haldane found World War I \u201ca very \nenjoyable experience\u201d and freely admitted that he \u201cenjoyed the opportunity of killing people.\u201d \nHe was himself wounded twice. After the war he became a successful popularizer of science \nand wrote twenty-three books (as well as over four hundred scientific papers). His books are \nstill thoroughly readable and instructive, though not always easy to find. He also became an \nenthusiastic Marxist. It has been suggested, not altogether cynically, that this was out of a \npurely contrarian instinct, and that if he had been born in the Soviet Union he would have \nbeen a passionate monarchist. At all events, most of his articles first appeared in the \nCommunist Daily Worker. \n    Whereas his father\u2019s principal interests concerned miners and poisoning, the younger \nHaldane became obsessed with saving submariners and divers from the unpleasant \nconsequences of their work. With Admiralty funding he acquired a decompression chamber \nthat he called the \u201cpressure pot.\u201d This was a metal cylinder into which three people at a time \ncould be sealed and subjected to tests of various types, all painful and nearly all dangerous. \nVolunteers might be required to sit in ice water while breathing \u201caberrant atmosphere\u201d or \nsubjected to rapid changes of pressurization. In one experiment, Haldane simulated a \ndangerously hasty ascent to see what would happen. What happened was that the dental \nfillings in his teeth exploded. \u201cAlmost every experiment,\u201d Norton writes, \u201cended with \nsomeone having a seizure, bleeding, or vomiting.\u201d The chamber was virtually soundproof, so \nthe only way for occupants to signal unhappiness or distress was to tap insistently on the \nchamber wall or to hold up notes to a small window. \n    On another occasion, while poisoning himself with elevated levels of oxygen, Haldane had \na fit so severe that he crushed several vertebrae. Collapsed lungs were a routine hazard. \nPerforated eardrums were quite common, but, as Haldane reassuringly noted in one of his \nessays, \u201cthe drum generally heals up; and if a hole remains in it, although one is somewhat \ndeaf, one can blow tobacco smoke out of the ear in question, which is a social \naccomplishment.\u201d \n    What was extraordinary about this was not that Haldane was willing to subject himself to \nsuch risk and discomfort in the pursuit of science, but that he had no trouble talking \ncolleagues and loved ones into climbing into the chamber, too. Sent on a simulated descent, \nhis wife once had a fit that lasted thirteen minutes. When at last she stopped bouncing across \nthe floor, she was helped to her feet and sent home to cook dinner. Haldane happily employed \nwhoever happened to be around, including on one memorable occasion a former prime \nminister of Spain, Juan Negr\u00edn. Dr. Negr\u00edn complained afterward of minor tingling and \u201ca \ncurious velvety sensation on the lips\u201d but otherwise seems to have escaped unharmed. He may \nhave considered himself very lucky. A similar experiment with oxygen deprivation left \nHaldane without feeling in his buttocks and lower spine for six years. \n    Among Haldane\u2019s many specific preoccupations was nitrogen intoxication. For reasons that \nare still poorly understood, beneath depths of about a hundred feet nitrogen becomes a \npowerful intoxicant. Under its influence divers had been known to offer their air hoses to \npassing fish or decide to try to have a smoke break. It also produced wild mood swings. In \none test, Haldane noted, the subject \u201calternated between depression and elation, at one \nmoment begging to be decompressed because he felt \u2018bloody awful\u2019 and the next minute \nlaughing and attempting to interfere with his colleague\u2019s dexterity test.\u201d In order to measurethe rate of deterioration in the subject, a scientist had to go into the chamber with the \nvolunteer to conduct simple mathematical tests. But after a few minutes, as Haldane later \nrecalled, \u201cthe tester was usually as intoxicated as the testee, and often forgot to press the \nspindle of his stopwatch, or to take proper notes.\u201d The cause of the inebriation is even now a \nmystery. It is thought that it may be the same thing that causes alcohol intoxication, but as no \none knows for certain what causes that we are none the wiser. At all events, without the \ngreatest care, it is easy to get in trouble once you leave the surface world. \n  \n    Which brings us back (well, nearly) to our earlier observation that Earth is not the easiest \nplace to be an organism, even if it is the only place. Of the small portion of the planet\u2019s \nsurface that is dry enough to stand on, a surprisingly large amount is too hot or cold or dry or \nsteep or lofty to be of much use to us. Partly, it must be conceded, this is our fault. In terms of \nadaptability, humans are pretty amazingly useless. Like most animals, we don\u2019t much like \nreally hot places, but because we sweat so freely and easily stroke, we are especially \nvulnerable. In the worst circumstances\u2014on foot without water in a hot desert\u2014most people \nwill grow delirious and keel over, possibly never to rise again, in no more than six or seven \nhours. We are no less helpless in the face of cold. Like all mammals, humans are good at \ngenerating heat but\u2014because we are so nearly hairless\u2014not good at keeping it. Even in quite \nmild weather half the calories you burn go to keep your body warm. Of course, we can \ncounter these frailties to a large extent by employing clothing and shelter, but even so the \nportions of Earth on which we are prepared or able to live are modest indeed: just 12 percent \nof the total land area, and only 4 percent of the whole surface if you include the seas. \n    Yet when you consider conditions elsewhere in the known universe, the wonder is not that \nwe use so little of our planet but that we have managed to find a planet that we can use even a \nbit of. You have only to look at our own solar system\u2014or, come to that, Earth at certain \nperiods in its own history\u2014to appreciate that most places are much harsher and much less \namenable to life than our mild, blue watery globe. \n    So far space scientists have discovered about seventy planets outside the solar system, out \nof the ten billion trillion or so that are thought to be out there, so humans can hardly claim to \nspeak with authority on the matter, but it appears that if you wish to have a planet suitable for \nlife, you have to be just awfully lucky, and the more advanced the life, the luckier you have to \nbe. Various observers have identified about two dozen particularly helpful breaks we have \nhad on Earth, but this is a flying survey so we\u2019ll distill them down to the principal four. They \nare: \n \nExcellent location.We are, to an almost uncanny degree, the right distance from the right sort \nof star, one that is big enough to radiate lots of energy, but not so big as to burn itself out \nswiftly. It is a curiosity of physics that the larger a star the more rapidly it burns. Had our sun \nbeen ten times as massive, it would have exhausted itself after ten million years instead of ten \nbillion and we wouldn\u2019t be here now. We are also fortunate to orbit where we do. Too much \nnearer and everything on Earth would have boiled away. Much farther away and everything \nwould have frozen. \n    In 1978, an astrophysicist named Michael Hart made some calculations and concluded that \nEarth would have been uninhabitable had it been just 1 percent farther from or 5 percentcloser to the Sun. That\u2019s not much, and in fact it wasn\u2019t enough. The figures have since been \nrefined and made a little more generous\u20145 percent nearer and 15 percent farther are thought \nto be more accurate assessments for our zone of habitability\u2014but that is still a narrow belt.1  \n    To appreciate just how narrow, you have only to look at Venus. Venus is only twenty-five \nmillion miles closer to the Sun than we are. The Sun\u2019s warmth reaches it just two minutes \nbefore it touches us. In size and composition, Venus is very like Earth, but the small \ndifference in orbital distance made all the difference to how it turned out. It appears that \nduring the early years of the solar system Venus was only slightly warmer than Earth and \nprobably had oceans. But those few degrees of extra warmth meant that Venus could not hold \non to its surface water, with disastrous consequences for its climate. As its water evaporated, \nthe hydrogen atoms escaped into space, and the oxygen atoms combined with carbon to form \na dense atmosphere of the greenhouse gas CO2. Venus became stifling. Although people of \nmy age will recall a time when astronomers hoped that Venus might harbor life beneath its \npadded clouds, possibly even a kind of tropical verdure, we now know that it is much too \nfierce an environment for any kind of life that we can reasonably conceive of. Its surface \ntemperature is a roasting 470 degrees centigrade (roughly 900 degrees Fahrenheit), which is \nhot enough to melt lead, and the atmospheric pressure at the surface is ninety times that of \nEarth, or more than any human body could withstand. We lack the technology to make suits \nor even spaceships that would allow us to visit. Our knowledge of Venus\u2019s surface is based on \ndistant radar imagery and some startled squawks from an unmanned Soviet probe that was \ndropped hopefully into the clouds in 1972 and functioned for barely an hour before \npermanently shutting down. \n    So that\u2019s what happens when you move two light minutes closer to the Sun. Travel farther \nout and the problem becomes not heat but cold, as Mars frigidly attests. It, too, was once a \nmuch more congenial place, but couldn\u2019t retain a usable atmosphere and turned into a frozen \nwaste. \n    But just being the right distance from the Sun cannot be the whole story, for otherwise the \nMoon would be forested and fair, which patently it is not. For that you need to have: \n \n    The right kind of planet.I don\u2019t imagine even many geophysicists, when asked to count \ntheir blessings, would include living on a planet with a molten interior, but it\u2019s a pretty near \ncertainty that without all that magma swirling around beneath us we wouldn\u2019t be here now. \nApart from much else, our lively interior created the outgassing that helped to build an \natmosphere and provided us with the magnetic field that shields us from cosmic radiation. It \nalso gave us plate tectonics, which continually renews and rumples the surface. If Earth were \nperfectly smooth, it would be covered everywhere with water to a depth of four kilometers. \nThere might be life in that lonesome ocean, but there certainly wouldn\u2019t be baseball. \n    In addition to having a beneficial interior, we also have the right elements in the correct \nproportions. In the most literal way, we are made of the right stuff. This is so crucial to our \nwell-being that we are going to discuss it more fully in a minute, but first we need to consider \nthe two remaining factors, beginning with another one that is often overlooked: \n                                                 \n1 The discovery of extremophiles in the boiling mudpots of Yellowstone and similar organisms found elsewhere \nmade scientists realize that actually life of a type could range much farther than that-even, perhaps, beneath the \nicy skin of Pluto. What we are talking about here are the conditions that would produce reasonably complex \nsurface creatures.We\u2019re a twin planet.Not many of us normally think of the Moon as a companion planet, \nbut that is in effect what it is. Most moons are tiny in relation to their master planet. The \nMartian satellites of Phobos and Deimos, for instance, are only about ten kilometers in \ndiameter. Our Moon, however, is more than a quarter the diameter of the Earth, which makes \nours the only planet in the solar system with a sizeable moon in comparison to itself (except \nPluto, which doesn\u2019t really count because Pluto is itself so small), and what a difference that \nmakes to us. \n    Without the Moon\u2019s steadying influence, the Earth would wobble like a dying top, with \ngoodness knows what consequences for climate and weather. The Moon\u2019s steady gravitational \ninfluence keeps the Earth spinning at the right speed and angle to provide the sort of stability \nnecessary for the long and successful development of life. This won\u2019t go on forever. The \nMoon is slipping from our grasp at a rate of about 1.5 inches a year. In another two billion \nyears it will have receded so far that it won\u2019t keep us steady and we will have to come up with \nsome other solution, but in the meantime you should think of it as much more than just a \npleasant feature in the night sky. \n    For a long time, astronomers assumed that the Moon and Earth either formed together or \nthat the Earth captured the Moon as it drifted by. We now believe, as you will recall from an \nearlier chapter, that about 4.5 billion years ago a Mars-sized object slammed into Earth, \nblowing out enough material to create the Moon from the debris. This was obviously a very \ngood thing for us\u2014but especially so as it happened such a long time ago. If it had happened in \n1896 or last Wednesday clearly we wouldn\u2019t be nearly so pleased about it. Which brings us to \nour fourth and in many ways most crucial consideration: \n \n    Timing.The universe is an amazingly fickle and eventful place, and our existence within it \nis a wonder. If a long and unimaginably complex sequence of events stretching back 4.6 \nbillion years or so hadn\u2019t played out in a particular manner at particular times\u2014if, to take just \none obvious instance, the dinosaurs hadn\u2019t been wiped out by a meteor when they were\u2014you \nmight well be six inches long, with whiskers and a tail, and reading this in a burrow. \n    We don\u2019t really know for sure because we have nothing else to compare our own existence \nto, but it seems evident that if you wish to end up as a moderately advanced, thinking society, \nyou need to be at the right end of a very long chain of outcomes involving reasonable periods \nof stability interspersed with just the right amount of stress and challenge (ice ages appear to \nbe especially helpful in this regard) and marked by a total absence of real cataclysm. As we \nshall see in the pages that remain to us, we are very lucky to find ourselves in that position. \n    And on that note, let us now turn briefly to the elements that made us. \n  \n    There are ninety-two naturally occurring elements on Earth, plus a further twenty or so that \nhave been created in labs, but some of these we can immediately put to one side\u2014as, in fact, \nchemists themselves tend to do. Not a few of our earthly chemicals are surprisingly little \nknown. Astatine, for instance, is practically unstudied. It has a name and a place on the \nperiodic table (next door to Marie Curie\u2019s polonium), but almost nothing else. The problemisn\u2019t scientific indifference, but rarity. There just isn\u2019t much astatine out there. The most \nelusive element of all, however, appears to be francium, which is so rare that it is thought that \nour entire planet may contain, at any given moment, fewer than twenty francium atoms. \nAltogether only about thirty of the naturally occurring elements are widespread on Earth, and \nbarely half a dozen are of central importance to life. \n    As you might expect, oxygen is our most abundant element, accounting for just under 50 \npercent of the Earth\u2019s crust, but after that the relative abundances are often surprising. Who \nwould guess, for instance, that silicon is the second most common element on Earth or that \ntitanium is tenth? Abundance has little to do with their familiarity or utility to us. Many of the \nmore obscure elements are actually more common than the better-known ones. There is more \ncerium on Earth than copper, more neodymium and lanthanum than cobalt or nitrogen. Tin \nbarely makes it into the top fifty, eclipsed by such relative obscurities as praseodymium, \nsamarium, gadolinium, and dysprosium. \n    Abundance also has little to do with ease of detection. Aluminum is the fourth most \ncommon element on Earth, accounting for nearly a tenth of everything that\u2019s underneath your \nfeet, but its existence wasn\u2019t even suspected until it was discovered in the nineteenth century \nby Humphry Davy, and for a long time after that it was treated as rare and precious. Congress \nnearly put a shiny lining of aluminum foil atop the Washington Monument to show what a \nclassy and prosperous nation we had become, and the French imperial family in the same \nperiod discarded the state silver dinner service and replaced it with an aluminum one. The \nfashion was cutting edge even if the knives weren\u2019t. \n    Nor does abundance necessarily relate to importance. Carbon is only the fifteenth most \ncommon element, accounting for a very modest 0.048 percent of Earth\u2019s crust, but we would \nbe lost without it. What sets the carbon atom apart is that it is shamelessly promiscuous. It is \nthe party animal of the atomic world, latching on to many other atoms (including itself) and \nholding tight, forming molecular conga lines of hearty robustness\u2014the very trick of nature \nnecessary to build proteins and DNA. As Paul Davies has written: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for carbon, life \nas we know it would be impossible. Probably any sort of life would be impossible.\u201d Yet \ncarbon is not all that plentiful even in humans, who so vitally depend on it. Of every 200 \natoms in your body, 126 are hydrogen, 51 are oxygen, and just 19 are carbon.2  \n    Other elements are critical not for creating life but for sustaining it. We need iron to \nmanufacture hemoglobin, and without it we would die. Cobalt is necessary for the creation of \nvitamin B12. Potassium and a very little sodium are literally good for your nerves. \nMolybdenum, manganese, and vanadium help to keep your enzymes purring. Zinc\u2014bless it\u2014\noxidizes alcohol. \n    We have evolved to utilize or tolerate these things\u2014we could hardly be here otherwise\u2014\nbut even then we live within narrow ranges of acceptance. Selenium is vital to all of us, but \ntake in just a little too much and it will be the last thing you ever do. The degree to which \norganisms require or tolerate certain elements is a relic of their evolution. Sheep and cattle \nnow graze side by side, but actually have very different mineral requirements. Modern cattle \nneed quite a lot of copper because they evolved in parts of Europe and Africa where copper \nwas abundant. Sheep, on the other hand, evolved in copper-poor areas of Asia Minor. As a \nrule, and not surprisingly, our tolerance for elements is directly proportionate to their \n                                                 \n2 Of the remaining four, three are nitrogen and the remaining atom is divided among all the other elements.abundance in the Earth\u2019s crust. We have evolved to expect, and in some cases actually need, \nthe tiny amounts of rare elements that accumulate in the flesh or fiber that we eat. But step up \nthe doses, in some cases by only a tiny amount, and we can soon cross a threshold. Much of \nthis is only imperfectly understood. No one knows, for example, whether a tiny amount of \narsenic is necessary for our well-being or not. Some authorities say it is; some not. All that is \ncertain is that too much of it will kill you. \n    The properties of the elements can become more curious still when they are combined. \nOxygen and hydrogen, for instance, are two of the most combustion-friendly elements around, \nbut put them together and they make incombustible water.3 Odder still in combination are \nsodium, one of the most unstable of all elements, and chlorine, one of the most toxic. Drop a \nsmall lump of pure sodium into ordinary water and it will explode with enough force to kill. \nChlorine is even more notoriously hazardous. Though useful in small concentrations for \nkilling microorganisms (it\u2019s chlorine you smell in bleach), in larger volumes it is lethal. \nChlorine was the element of choice for many of the poison gases of the First World War. And, \nas many a sore-eyed swimmer will attest, even in exceedingly dilute form the human body \ndoesn\u2019t appreciate it. Yet put these two nasty elements together and what do you get? Sodium \nchloride\u2014common table salt. \n    By and large, if an element doesn\u2019t naturally find its way into our systems\u2014if it isn\u2019t \nsoluble in water, say\u2014we tend to be intolerant of it. Lead poisons us because we were never \nexposed to it until we began to fashion it into food vessels and pipes for plumbing. (Not \nincidentally, lead\u2019s symbol is Pb, for the Latin plumbum, the source word for our modern \nplumbing.) The Romans also flavored their wine with lead, which may be part of the reason \nthey are not the force they used to be. As we have seen elsewhere, our own performance with \nlead (not to mention mercury, cadmium, and all the other industrial pollutants with which we \nroutinely dose ourselves) does not leave us a great deal of room for smirking. When elements \ndon\u2019t occur naturally on Earth, we have evolved no tolerance for them, and so they tend to be \nextremely toxic to us, as with plutonium. Our tolerance for plutonium is zero: there is no level \nat which it is not going to make you want to lie down. \n    I have brought you a long way to make a small point: a big part of the reason that Earth \nseems so miraculously accommodating is that we evolved to suit its conditions. What we \nmarvel at is not that it is suitable to life but that it is suitable to our life\u2014and hardly \nsurprising, really. It may be that many of the things that make it so splendid to us\u2014well-\nproportioned Sun, doting Moon, sociable carbon, more magma than you can shake a stick at, \nand all the rest\u2014seem splendid simply because they are what we were born to count on. No \none can altogether say. \n    Other worlds may harbor beings thankful for their silvery lakes of mercury and drifting \nclouds of ammonia. They may be delighted that their planet doesn\u2019t shake them silly with its \ngrinding plates or spew messy gobs of lava over the landscape, but rather exists in a \npermanent nontectonic tranquility. Any visitors to Earth from afar would almost certainly, at \nthe very least, be bemused to find us living in an atmosphere composed of nitrogen, a gas \nsulkily disinclined to react with anything, and oxygen, which is so partial to combustion that \nwe must place fire stations throughout our cities to protect ourselves from its livelier effects. \nBut even if our visitors were oxygen-breathing bipeds with shopping malls and a fondness for \n                                                 \n3 Oxygen itself is not combustible; it merely facilitates the combus tion of other things. This is just as well, for if \noxygen were corn bustible, each time you lit a match all the air around you would bur into flame. Hydrogen gas, \non the other hand, is extremely corn bustible, as the dirigible Hindenburg demonstrated on May 6, 193 in \nLakehurst, New Jersey, when its hydrogen fuel burst explosive) into flame, killing thirty-six people.action movies, it is unlikely that they would find Earth ideal. We couldn\u2019t even give them \nlunch because all our foods contain traces of manganese, selenium, zinc, and other elemental \nparticles at least some of which would be poisonous to them. To them Earth might not seem a \nwondrously congenial place at all. \n    The physicist Richard Feynman used to make a joke about a posteriori conclusions, as they \nare called. \u201cYou know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight,\u201d he would say. \u201cI \nsaw a car with the license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license \nplates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? \nAmazing!\u201d His point, of course, was that it is easy to make any banal situation seem \nextraordinary if you treat it as fateful. \n    So it is possible that the events and conditions that led to the rise of life on Earth are not \nquite as extraordinary as we like to think. Still, they were extraordinary enough, and one thing \nis certain: they will have to do until we find some better.", "17": "17   INTO THE TROPOSPHERE \n \n \n \nTHANK GOODNESS FOR the atmosphere. It keeps us warm. Without it, Earth would be a \nlifeless ball of ice with an average temperature of minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, \nthe atmosphere absorbs or deflects incoming swarms of cosmic rays, charged particles, \nultraviolet rays, and the like. Altogether, the gaseous padding of the atmosphere is equivalent \nto a fifteen-foot thickness of protective concrete, and without it these invisible visitors from \nspace would slice through us like tiny daggers. Even raindrops would pound us senseless if it \nweren\u2019t for the atmosphere\u2019s slowing drag. \n    The most striking thing about our atmosphere is that there isn\u2019t very much of it. It extends \nupward for about 120 miles, which might seem reasonably bounteous when viewed from \nground level, but if you shrank the Earth to the size of a standard desktop globe it would only \nbe about the thickness of a couple of coats of varnish. \n    For scientific convenience, the atmosphere is divided into four unequal layers: troposphere, \nstratosphere, mesosphere, and ionosphere (now often called the thermosphere). The \ntroposphere is the part that\u2019s dear to us. It alone contains enough warmth and oxygen to allow \nus to function, though even it swiftly becomes uncongenial to life as you climb up through it. \nFrom ground level to its highest point, the troposphere (or \u201cturning sphere\u201d) is about ten miles \nthick at the equator and no more than six or seven miles high in the temperate latitudes where \nmost of us live. Eighty percent of the atmosphere\u2019s mass, virtually all the water, and thus \nvirtually all the weather are contained within this thin and wispy layer. There really isn\u2019t \nmuch between you and oblivion. \n    Beyond the troposphere is the stratosphere. When you see the top of a storm cloud \nflattening out into the classic anvil shape, you are looking at the boundary between the \ntroposphere and stratosphere. This invisible ceiling is known as the tropopause and was \ndiscovered in 1902 by a Frenchman in a balloon, L\u00e9on-Philippe Teisserenc de Bort. Pause in \nthis sense doesn\u2019t mean to stop momentarily but to cease altogether; it\u2019s from the same Greek \nroot as menopause. Even at its greatest extent, the tropopause is not very distant. A fast \nelevator of the sort used in modern skyscrapers could get you there in about twenty minutes, \nthough you would be well advised not to make the trip. Such a rapid ascent without \npressurization would, at the very least, result in severe cerebral and pulmonary edemas, a \ndangerous excess of fluids in the body\u2019s tissues. When the doors opened at the viewing \nplatform, anyone inside would almost certainly be dead or dying. Even a more measured \nascent would be accompanied by a great deal of discomfort. The temperature six miles up can \nbe -70 degrees Fahrenheit, and you would need, or at least very much appreciate, \nsupplementary oxygen. \n    After you have left the troposphere the temperature soon warms up again, to about 40 \ndegrees Fahrenheit, thanks to the absorptive effects of ozone (something else de Bort \ndiscovered on his daring 1902 ascent). It then plunges to as low as -130 degrees Fahrenheit in \nthe mesosphere before skyrocketing to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit or more in the aptly named \nbut very erratic thermosphere, where temperatures can vary by a thousand degrees from dayto night\u2014though it must be said that \u201ctemperature\u201d at such a height becomes a somewhat \nnotional concept. Temperature is really just a measure of the activity of molecules. At sea \nlevel, air molecules are so thick that one molecule can move only the tiniest distance\u2014about \nthree-millionths of an inch, to be precise\u2014before banging into another. Because trillions of \nmolecules are constantly colliding, a lot of heat gets exchanged. But at the height of the \nthermosphere, at fifty miles or more, the air is so thin that any two molecules will be miles \napart and hardly ever come in contact. So although each molecule is very warm, there are few \ninteractions between them and thus little heat transference. This is good news for satellites \nand spaceships because if the exchange of heat were more efficient any man-made object \norbiting at that level would burst into flame. \n    Even so, spaceships have to take care in the outer atmosphere, particularly on return trips to \nEarth, as the space shuttle Columbia demonstrated all too tragically in February 2003. \nAlthough the atmosphere is very thin, if a craft comes in at too steep an angle\u2014more than \nabout 6 degrees\u2014or too swiftly it can strike enough molecules to generate drag of an \nexceedingly combustible nature. Conversely, if an incoming vehicle hit the thermosphere at \ntoo shallow an angle, it could well bounce back into space, like a pebble skipped across water. \n    But you needn\u2019t venture to the edge of the atmosphere to be reminded of what hopelessly \nground-hugging beings we are. As anyone who has spent time in a lofty city will know, you \ndon\u2019t have to rise too many thousands of feet from sea level before your body begins to \nprotest. Even experienced mountaineers, with the benefits of fitness, training, and bottled \noxygen, quickly become vulnerable at height to confusion, nausea, exhaustion, frostbite, \nhypothermia, migraine, loss of appetite, and a great many other stumbling dysfunctions. In a \nhundred emphatic ways the human body reminds its owner that it wasn\u2019t designed to operate \nso far above sea level. \n    \u201cEven under the most favorable circumstances,\u201d the climber Peter Habeler has written of \nconditions atop Everest, \u201cevery step at that altitude demands a colossal effort of will. You \nmust force yourself to make every movement, reach for every handhold. You are perpetually \nthreatened by a leaden, deadly fatigue.\u201d In The Other Side of Everest, the British mountaineer \nand filmmaker Matt Dickinson records how Howard Somervell, on a 1924 British expedition \nup Everest, \u201cfound himself choking to death after a piece of infected flesh came loose and \nblocked his windpipe.\u201d With a supreme effort Somervell managed to cough up the \nobstruction. It turned out to be \u201cthe entire mucus lining of his larynx.\u201d \n    Bodily distress is notorious above 25,000 feet\u2014the area known to climbers as the Death \nZone\u2014but many people become severely debilitated, even dangerously ill, at heights of no \nmore than 15,000 feet or so. Susceptibility has little to do with fitness. Grannies sometimes \ncaper about in lofty situations while their fitter offspring are reduced to helpless, groaning \nheaps until conveyed to lower altitudes. \n    The absolute limit of human tolerance for continuous living appears to be about 5,500 \nmeters, or 18,000 feet, but even people conditioned to living at altitude could not tolerate such \nheights for long. Frances Ashcroft, in Life at the Extremes, notes that there are Andean sulfur \nmines at 5,800 meters, but that the miners prefer to descend 460 meters each evening and \nclimb back up the following day, rather than live continuously at that elevation. People who \nhabitually live at altitude have often spent thousands of years developing disproportionately \nlarge chests and lungs, increasing their density of oxygen-bearing red blood cells by almost a \nthird, though there are limits to how much thickening with red cells the blood supply canstand. Moreover, above 5,500 meters even the most well-adapted women cannot provide a \ngrowing fetus with enough oxygen to bring it to its full term. \n    In the 1780s when people began to make experimental balloon ascents in Europe, \nsomething that surprised them was how chilly it got as they rose. The temperature drops about \n3 degrees Fahrenheit with every thousand feet you climb. Logic would seem to indicate that \nthe closer you get to a source of heat, the warmer you would feel. Part of the explanation is \nthat you are not really getting nearer the Sun in any meaningful sense. The Sun is ninety-three \nmillion miles away. To move a couple of thousand feet closer to it is like taking one step \ncloser to a bushfire in Australia when you are standing in Ohio, and expecting to smell smoke. \nThe answer again takes us back to the question of the density of molecules in the atmosphere. \nSunlight energizes atoms. It increases the rate at which they jiggle and jounce, and in their \nenlivened state they crash into one another, releasing heat. When you feel the sun warm on \nyour back on a summer\u2019s day, it\u2019s really excited atoms you feel. The higher you climb, the \nfewer molecules there are, and so the fewer collisions between them. \n    Air is deceptive stuff. Even at sea level, we tend to think of the air as being ethereal and all \nbut weightless. In fact, it has plenty of bulk, and that bulk often exerts itself. As a marine \nscientist named Wyville Thomson wrote more than a century ago: \u201cWe sometimes find when \nwe get up in the morning, by a rise of an inch in the barometer, that nearly half a ton has been \nquietly piled upon us during the night, but we experience no inconvenience, rather a feeling of \nexhilaration and buoyancy, since it requires a little less exertion to move our bodies in the \ndenser medium.\u201d The reason you don\u2019t feel crushed under that extra half ton of pressure is the \nsame reason your body would not be crushed deep beneath the sea: it is made mostly of \nincompressible fluids, which push back, equalizing the pressures within and without. \n    But get air in motion, as with a hurricane or even a stiff breeze, and you will quickly be \nreminded that it has very considerable mass. Altogether there are about 5,200 million million \ntons of air around us\u201425 million tons for every square mile of the planet\u2014a not \ninconsequential volume. When you get millions of tons of atmosphere rushing past at thirty or \nforty miles an hour, it\u2019s hardly a surprise that limbs snap and roof tiles go flying. As Anthony \nSmith notes, a typical weather front may consist of 750 million tons of cold air pinned \nbeneath a billion tons of warmer air. Hardly a wonder that the result is at times \nmeteorologically exciting. \n    Certainly there is no shortage of energy in the world above our heads. One thunderstorm, it \nhas been calculated, can contain an amount of energy equivalent to four days\u2019 use of \nelectricity for the whole United States. In the right conditions, storm clouds can rise to heights \nof six to ten miles and contain updrafts and downdrafts of one hundred miles an hour. These \nare often side by side, which is why pilots don\u2019t want to fly through them. In all, the internal \nturmoil particles within the cloud pick up electrical charges. For reasons not entirely \nunderstood the lighter particles tend to become positively charged and to be wafted by air \ncurrents to the top of the cloud. The heavier particles linger at the base, accumulating negative \ncharges. These negatively charged particles have a powerful urge to rush to the positively \ncharged Earth, and good luck to anything that gets in their way. A bolt of lightning travels at \n270,000 miles an hour and can heat the air around it to a decidedly crisp 50,000 degrees \nFahrenheit, several times hotter than the surface of the sun. At any one moment 1,800 \nthunderstorms are in progress around the globe\u2014some 40,000 a day. Day and night across the \nplanet every second about a hundred lightning bolts hit the ground. The sky is a lively place.Much of our knowledge of what goes on up there is surprisingly recent. Jet streams, usually \nlocated about 30,000 to 35,000 feet up, can bowl along at up to 180 miles an hour and vastly \ninfluence weather systems over whole continents, yet their existence wasn\u2019t suspected until \npilots began to fly into them during the Second World War. Even now a great deal of \natmospheric phenomena is barely understood. A form of wave motion popularly known as \nclear-air turbulence occasionally enlivens airplane flights. About twenty such incidents a year \nare serious enough to need reporting. They are not associated with cloud structures or \nanything else that can be detected visually or by radar. They are just pockets of startling \nturbulence in the middle of tranquil skies. In a typical incident, a plane en route from \nSingapore to Sydney was flying over central Australia in calm conditions when it suddenly \nfell three hundred feet\u2014enough to fling unsecured people against the ceiling. Twelve people \nwere injured, one seriously. No one knows what causes such disruptive cells of air. \n  \n    The process that moves air around in the atmosphere is the same process that drives the \ninternal engine of the planet, namely convection. Moist, warm air from the equatorial regions \nrises until it hits the barrier of the tropopause and spreads out. As it travels away from the \nequator and cools, it sinks. When it hits bottom, some of the sinking air looks for an area of \nlow pressure to fill and heads back for the equator, completing the circuit. \n    At the equator the convection process is generally stable and the weather predictably fair, \nbut in temperate zones the patterns are far more seasonal, localized, and random, which \nresults in an endless battle between systems of high-pressure air and low. Low-pressure \nsystems are created by rising air, which conveys water molecules into the sky, forming clouds \nand eventually rain. Warm air can hold more moisture than cool air, which is why tropical and \nsummer storms tend to be the heaviest. Thus low areas tend to be associated with clouds and \nrain, and highs generally spell sunshine and fair weather. When two such systems meet, it \noften becomes manifest in the clouds. For instance, stratus clouds\u2014those unlovable, \nfeatureless sprawls that give us our overcast skies\u2014happen when moisture-bearing updrafts \nlack the oomph to break through a level of more stable air above, and instead spread out, like \nsmoke hitting a ceiling. Indeed, if you watch a smoker sometime, you can get a very good \nidea of how things work by watching how smoke rises from a cigarette in a still room. At \nfirst, it goes straight up (this is called a laminar flow, if you need to impress anyone), and then \nit spreads out in a diffused, wavy layer. The greatest supercomputer in the world, taking \nmeasurements in the most carefully controlled environment, cannot tell you what forms these \nripplings will take, so you can imagine the difficulties that confront meteorologists when they \ntry to predict such motions in a spinning, windy, large-scale world. \n    What we do know is that because heat from the Sun is unevenly distributed, differences in \nair pressure arise on the planet. Air can\u2019t abide this, so it rushes around trying to equalize \nthings everywhere. Wind is simply the air\u2019s way of trying to keep things in balance. Air \nalways flows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure (as you would expect; think \nof anything with air under pressure\u2014a balloon or an air tank\u2014and think how insistently that \npressured air wants to get someplace else), and the greater the discrepancy in pressures the \nfaster the wind blows. \n    Incidentally, wind speeds, like most things that accumulate, grow exponentially, so a wind \nblowing at two hundred miles an hour is not simply ten times stronger than a wind blowing at \ntwenty miles an hour, but a hundred times stronger\u2014and hence that much more destructive. \nIntroduce several million tons of air to this accelerator effect and the result can be exceedinglyenergetic. A tropical hurricane can release in twenty-four hours as much energy as a rich, \nmedium-sized nation like Britain or France uses in a year. \n    The impulse of the atmosphere to seek equilibrium was first suspected by Edmond \nHalley\u2014the man who was everywhere\u2014and elaborated upon in the eighteenth century by his \nfellow Briton George Hadley, who saw that rising and falling columns of air tended to \nproduce \u201ccells\u201d (known ever since as \u201cHadley cells\u201d). Though a lawyer by profession, Hadley \nhad a keen interest in the weather (he was, after all, English) and also suggested a link \nbetween his cells, the Earth\u2019s spin, and the apparent deflections of air that give us our trade \nwinds. However, it was an engineering professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris, \nGustave-Gaspard de Coriolis, who worked out the details of these interactions in 1835, and \nthus we call it the Coriolis effect. (Coriolis\u2019s other distinction at the school was to introduce \nwatercoolers, which are still known there as Corios, apparently.) The Earth revolves at a brisk \n1,041 miles an hour at the equator, though as you move toward the poles the rate slopes off \nconsiderably, to about 600 miles an hour in London or Paris, for instance. The reason for this \nis self-evident when you think about it. If you are on the equator the spinning Earth has to \ncarry you quite a distance\u2014about 40,000 kilometers\u2014to get you back to the same spot. If you \nstand beside the North Pole, however, you may need travel only a few feet to complete a \nrevolution, yet in both cases it takes twenty-four hours to get you back to where you began. \nTherefore, it follows that the closer you get to the equator the faster you must be spinning. \n    The Coriolis effect explains why anything moving through the air in a straight line laterally \nto the Earth\u2019s spin will, given enough distance, seem to curve to the right in the northern \nhemisphere and to the left in the southern as the Earth revolves beneath it. The standard way \nto envision this is to imagine yourself at the center of a large carousel and tossing a ball to \nsomeone positioned on the edge. By the time the ball gets to the perimeter, the target person \nhas moved on and the ball passes behind him. From his perspective, it looks as if it has curved \naway from him. That is the Coriolis effect, and it is what gives weather systems their curl and \nsends hurricanes spinning off like tops. The Coriolis effect is also why naval guns firing \nartillery shells have to adjust to left or right; a shell fired fifteen miles would otherwise \ndeviate by about a hundred yards and plop harmlessly into the sea. \n  \n    Considering the practical and psychological importance of the weather to nearly everyone, \nit\u2019s surprising that meteorology didn\u2019t really get going as a science until shortly before the \nturn of the nineteenth century (though the term meteorology itself had been around since \n1626, when it was coined by a T. Granger in a book of logic). \n    Part of the problem was that successful meteorology requires the precise measurement of \ntemperatures, and thermometers for a long time proved more difficult to make than you might \nexpect. An accurate reading was dependent on getting a very even bore in a glass tube, and \nthat wasn\u2019t easy to do. The first person to crack the problem was Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, a \nDutch maker of instruments, who produced an accurate thermometer in 1717. However, for \nreasons unknown he calibrated the instrument in a way that put freezing at 32 degrees and \nboiling at 212 degrees. From the outset this numeric eccentricity bothered some people, and in \n1742 Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer, came up with a competing scale. In proof of the \nproposition that inventors seldom get matters entirely right, Celsius made boiling point zero \nand freezing point 100 on his scale, but that was soon reversed.The person most frequently identified as the father of modern meteorology was an English \npharmacist named Luke Howard, who came to prominence at the beginning of the nineteenth \ncentury. Howard is chiefly remembered now for giving cloud types their names in 1803. \nAlthough he was an active and respected member of the Linnaean Society and employed \nLinnaean principles in his new scheme, Howard chose the rather more obscure Askesian \nSociety as the forum to announce his new system of classification. (The Askesian Society, \nyou may just recall from an earlier chapter, was the body whose members were unusually \ndevoted to the pleasures of nitrous oxide, so we can only hope they treated Howard\u2019s \npresentation with the sober attention it deserved. It is a point on which Howard scholars are \ncuriously silent.) \n    Howard divided clouds into three groups: stratus for the layered clouds, cumulus for the \nfluffy ones (the word means \u201cheaped\u201d in Latin), and cirrus (meaning \u201ccurled\u201d) for the high, \nthin feathery formations that generally presage colder weather. To these he subsequently \nadded a fourth term, nimbus (from the Latin for \u201ccloud\u201d), for a rain cloud. The beauty of \nHoward\u2019s system was that the basic components could be freely recombined to describe every \nshape and size of passing cloud\u2014stratocumulus, cirrostratus, cumulocongestus, and so on. It \nwas an immediate hit, and not just in England. The poet Johann von Goethe in Germany was \nso taken with the system that he dedicated four poems to Howard. \n    Howard\u2019s system has been much added to over the years, so much so that the encyclopedic \nif little read International Cloud Atlas runs to two volumes, but interestingly virtually all the \npost-Howard cloud types\u2014mammatus, pileus, nebulosis, spissatus, floccus, and mediocris are \na sampling\u2014have never caught on with anyone outside meteorology and not terribly much \nthere, I\u2019m told. Incidentally, the first, much thinner edition of that atlas, produced in 1896, \ndivided clouds into ten basic types, of which the plumpest and most cushiony-looking was \nnumber nine, cumulonimbus.1 That seems to have been the source of the expression \u201cto be on \ncloud nine.\u201d \n    For all the heft and fury of the occasional anvil-headed storm cloud, the average cloud is \nactually a benign and surprisingly insubstantial thing. A fluffy summer cumulus several \nhundred yards to a side may contain no more than twenty-five or thirty gallons of water\u2014\n\u201cabout enough to fill a bathtub,\u201d as James Trefil has noted. You can get some sense of the \nimmaterial quality of clouds by strolling through fog\u2014which is, after all, nothing more than a \ncloud that lacks the will to fly. To quote Trefil again: \u201cIf you walk 100 yards through a typical \nfog, you will come into contact with only about half a cubic inch of water\u2014not enough to \ngive you a decent drink.\u201d In consequence, clouds are not great reservoirs of water. Only about \n0.035 percent of the Earth\u2019s fresh water is floating around above us at any moment. \n    Depending on where it falls, the prognosis for a water molecule varies widely. If it lands in \nfertile soil it will be soaked up by plants or reevaporated directly within hours or days. If it \nfinds its way down to the groundwater, however, it may not see sunlight again for many \nyears\u2014thousands if it gets really deep. When you look at a lake, you are looking at a \ncollection of molecules that have been there on average for about a decade. In the ocean the \nresidence time is thought to be more like a hundred years. Altogether about 60 percent of \n                                                 \n1 If you have ever been struck by how beautifully crisp and well defined the edges of cumulus clouds tend to be, \nwhile other clouds are more blurry, the explanation is that in a cumulus cloud there is a pronounced boundary \nbetween the moist interior of the cloud and the dry air beyond it. Any water molecule that strays beyond the edge \nof the cloud is immediately zapped by the dry air beyond, allowing the cloud to keep its fine edge. Much higher \ncirrus clouds are composed of ice, and the zone between the edge of the cloud and the air beyond is not so \nclearly delineated, which is why they tend to be blurry at the edges.water molecules in a rainfall are returned to the atmosphere within a day or two. Once \nevaporated, they spend no more than a week or so\u2014Drury says twelve days\u2014in the sky \nbefore falling again as rain. \n    Evaporation is a swift process, as you can easily gauge by the fate of a puddle on a \nsummer\u2019s day. Even something as large as the Mediterranean would dry out in a thousand \nyears if it were not continually replenished. Such an event occurred a little under six million \nyears ago and provoked what is known to science as the Messinian Salinity Crisis. What \nhappened was that continental movement closed the Strait of Gibraltar. As the Mediterranean \ndried, its evaporated contents fell as freshwater rain into other seas, mildly diluting their \nsaltiness\u2014indeed, making them just dilute enough to freeze over larger areas than normal. \nThe enlarged area of ice bounced back more of the Sun\u2019s heat and pushed Earth into an ice \nage. So at least the theory goes. \n    What is certainly true, as far as we can tell, is that a little change in the Earth\u2019s dynamics \ncan have repercussions beyond our imagining. Such an event, as we shall see a little further \non, may even have created us. \n  \n    Oceans are the real powerhouse of the planet\u2019s surface behavior. Indeed, meteorologists \nincreasingly treat oceans and atmosphere as a single system, which is why we must give them \na little of our attention here. Water is marvelous at holding and transporting heat. Every day, \nthe Gulf Stream carries an amount of heat to Europe equivalent to the world\u2019s output of coal \nfor ten years, which is why Britain and Ireland have such mild winters compared with Canada \nand Russia. \n    But water also warms slowly, which is why lakes and swimming pools are cold even on the \nhottest days. For that reason there tends to be a lag in the official, astronomical start of a \nseason and the actual feeling that that season has started. So spring may officially start in the \nnorthern hemisphere in March, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it in most places until April at the very \nearliest. \n    The oceans are not one uniform mass of water. Their differences in temperature, salinity, \ndepth, density, and so on have huge effects on how they move heat around, which in turn \naffects climate. The Atlantic, for instance, is saltier than the Pacific, and a good thing too. The \nsaltier water is the denser it is, and dense water sinks. Without its extra burden of salt, the \nAtlantic currents would proceed up to the Arctic, warming the North Pole but depriving \nEurope of all that kindly warmth. The main agent of heat transfer on Earth is what is known \nas thermohaline circulation, which originates in slow, deep currents far below the surface\u2014a \nprocess first detected by the scientist-adventurer Count von Rumford in 1797.2 What happens \nis that surface waters, as they get to the vicinity of Europe, grow dense and sink to great \ndepths and begin a slow trip back to the southern hemisphere. When they reach Antarctica, \nthey are caught up in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, where they are driven onward into \nthe Pacific. The process is very slow\u2014it can take 1,500 years for water to travel from the \n                                                 \n2 The term means a number of things to different people, it appears. In November 2002, Carl Wunsch of MIT \npublished a report in Science, \"What Is the Thermohaline Circulation?,\" in which he noted that the expression \nhas been used in leading journals to signify at least seven different phenomena (circulation at the abyssal level, \ncirculation driven by differences in density or buoyancy, \"meridional overturning circulation of mass,\" and so \non)-though all have to do with ocean circulations and the transfer of heat, the cautiously vague and embracing \nsense in which I have employed it here.North Atlantic to the mid-Pacific\u2014but the volumes of heat and water they move are very \nconsiderable, and the influence on the climate is enormous. \n    (As for the question of how anyone could possibly figure out how long it takes a drop of \nwater to get from one ocean to another, the answer is that scientists can measure compounds \nin the water like chlorofluorocarbons and work out how long it has been since they were last \nin the air. By comparing a lot of measurements from different depths and locations they can \nreasonably chart the water\u2019s movement.) \n    Thermohaline circulation not only moves heat around, but also helps to stir up nutrients as \nthe currents rise and fall, making greater volumes of the ocean habitable for fish and other \nmarine creatures. Unfortunately, it appears the circulation may also be very sensitive to \nchange. According to computer simulations, even a modest dilution of the ocean\u2019s salt \ncontent\u2014from increased melting of the Greenland ice sheet, for instance\u2014could disrupt the \ncycle disastrously. \n    The seas do one other great favor for us. They soak up tremendous volumes of carbon and \nprovide a means for it to be safely locked away. One of the oddities of our solar system is that \nthe Sun burns about 25 percent more brightly now than when the solar system was young. \nThis should have resulted in a much warmer Earth. Indeed, as the English geologist Aubrey \nManning has put it, \u201cThis colossal change should have had an absolutely catastrophic effect \non the Earth and yet it appears that our world has hardly been affected.\u201d \n    So what keeps the world stable and cool? \n    Life does. Trillions upon trillions of tiny marine organisms that most of us have never \nheard of\u2014foraminiferans and coccoliths and calcareous algae\u2014capture atmospheric carbon, \nin the form of carbon dioxide, when it falls as rain and use it (in combination with other \nthings) to make their tiny shells. By locking the carbon up in their shells, they keep it from \nbeing reevaporated into the atmosphere, where it would build up dangerously as a greenhouse \ngas. Eventually all the tiny foraminiferans and coccoliths and so on die and fall to the bottom \nof the sea, where they are compressed into limestone. It is remarkable, when you behold an \nextraordinary natural feature like the White Cliffs of Dover in England, to reflect that it is \nmade up of nothing but tiny deceased marine organisms, but even more remarkable when you \nrealize how much carbon they cumulatively sequester. A six-inch cube of Dover chalk will \ncontain well over a thousand liters of compressed carbon dioxide that would otherwise be \ndoing us no good at all. Altogether there is about twenty thousand times as much carbon \nlocked away in the Earth\u2019s rocks as in the atmosphere. Eventually much of that limestone will \nend up feeding volcanoes, and the carbon will return to the atmosphere and fall to the Earth in \nrain, which is why the whole is called the long-term carbon cycle. The process takes a very \nlong time\u2014about half a million years for a typical carbon atom\u2014but in the absence of any \nother disturbance it works remarkably well at keeping the climate stable. \n    Unfortunately, human beings have a careless predilection for disrupting this cycle by \nputting lots of extra carbon into the atmosphere whether the foraminiferans are ready for it or \nnot. Since 1850, it has been estimated, we have lofted about a hundred billion tons of extra \ncarbon into the air, a total that increases by about seven billion tons each year. Overall, that\u2019s \nnot actually all that much. Nature\u2014mostly through the belchings of volcanoes and the decay \nof plants\u2014sends about 200 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year, \nnearly thirty times as much as we do with our cars and factories. But you have only to look at \nthe haze that hangs over our cities to see what a difference our contribution makes.We know from samples of very old ice that the \u201cnatural\u201d level of carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere\u2014that is, before we started inflating it with industrial activity\u2014is about 280 parts \nper million. By 1958, when people in lab coats started to pay attention to it, it had risen to 315 \nparts per million. Today it is over 360 parts per million and rising by roughly one-quarter of 1 \npercent a year. By the end of the twenty-first century it is forecast to rise to about 560 parts \nper million. \n    So far, the Earth\u2019s oceans and forests (which also pack away a lot of carbon) have managed \nto save us from ourselves, but as Peter Cox of the British Meteorological Office puts it: \n\u201cThere is a critical threshold where the natural biosphere stops buffering us from the effects of \nour emissions and actually starts to amplify them.\u201d The fear is that there would be a runaway \nincrease in the Earth\u2019s warming. Unable to adapt, many trees and other plants would die, \nreleasing their stores of carbon and adding to the problem. Such cycles have occasionally \nhappened in the distant past even without a human contribution. The good news is that even \nhere nature is quite wonderful. It is almost certain that eventually the carbon cycle would \nreassert itself and return the Earth to a situation of stability and happiness. The last time this \nhappened, it took a mere sixty thousand years.", "18": "18    THE BOUNDING MAIN \n \n \n \nIMAGINE TRYING TO live in a world dominated by dihydrogen oxide, a compound that has \nno taste or smell and is so variable in its properties that it is generally benign but at other \ntimes swiftly lethal. Depending on its state, it can scald you or freeze you. In the presence of \ncertain organic molecules it can form carbonic acids so nasty that they can strip the leaves \nfrom trees and eat the faces off statuary. In bulk, when agitated, it can strike with a fury that \nno human edifice could withstand. Even for those who have learned to live with it, it is an \noften murderous substance. We call it water. \n    Water is everywhere. A potato is 80 percent water, a cow 74 percent, a bacterium 75 \npercent. A tomato, at 95 percent, is little but water. Even humans are 65 percent water, \nmaking us more liquid than solid by a margin of almost two to one. Water is strange stuff. It is \nformless and transparent, and yet we long to be beside it. It has no taste and yet we love the \ntaste of it. We will travel great distances and pay small fortunes to see it in sunshine. And \neven though we know it is dangerous and drowns tens of thousands of people every year, we \ncan\u2019t wait to frolic in it. \n    Because water is so ubiquitous we tend to overlook what an extraordinary substance it is. \nAlmost nothing about it can be used to make reliable predictions about the properties of other \nliquids and vice versa. If you knew nothing of water and based your assumptions on the \nbehavior of compounds most chemically akin to it\u2014hydrogen selenide or hydrogen sulphide \nnotably\u2014you would expect it to boil at minus 135 degrees Fahrenheit and to be a gas at room \ntemperature. \n    Most liquids when chilled contract by about 10 percent. Water does too, but only down to a \npoint. Once it is within whispering distance of freezing, it begins\u2014perversely, beguilingly, \nextremely improbably\u2014to expand. By the time it is solid, it is almost a tenth more \nvoluminous than it was before. Because it expands, ice floats on water\u2014\u201can utterly bizarre \nproperty,\u201d according to John Gribbin. If it lacked this splendid waywardness, ice would sink, \nand lakes and oceans would freeze from the bottom up. Without surface ice to hold heat in, \nthe water\u2019s warmth would radiate away, leaving it even chillier and creating yet more ice. \nSoon even the oceans would freeze and almost certainly stay that way for a very long time, \nprobably forever\u2014hardly the conditions to nurture life. Thankfully for us, water seems \nunaware of the rules of chemistry or laws of physics. \n    Everyone knows that water\u2019s chemical formula is H2O, which means that it consists of one \nlargish oxygen atom with two smaller hydrogen atoms attached to it. The hydrogen atoms \ncling fiercely to their oxygen host, but also make casual bonds with other water molecules. \nThe nature of a water molecule means that it engages in a kind of dance with other water \nmolecules, briefly pairing and then moving on, like the ever-changing partners in a quadrille, \nto use Robert Kunzig\u2019s nice phrase. A glass of water may not appear terribly lively, but every \nmolecule in it is changing partners billions of times a second. That\u2019s why water molecules \nstick together to form bodies like puddles and lakes, but not so tightly that they can\u2019t be easilyseparated as when, for instance, you dive into a pool of them. At any given moment only 15 \npercent of them are actually touching. \n    In one sense the bond is very strong\u2014it is why water molecules can flow uphill when \nsiphoned and why water droplets on a car hood show such a singular determination to bead \nwith their partners. It is also why water has surface tension. The molecules at the surface are \nattracted more powerfully to the like molecules beneath and beside them than to the air \nmolecules above. This creates a sort of membrane strong enough to support insects and \nskipping stones. It is what gives the sting to a belly flop. \n    I hardly need point out that we would be lost without it. Deprived of water, the human body \nrapidly falls apart. Within days, the lips vanish \u201cas if amputated, the gums blacken, the nose \nwithers to half its length, and the skin so contracts around the eyes as to prevent blinking.\u201d \nWater is so vital to us that it is easy to overlook that all but the smallest fraction of the water \non Earth is poisonous to us\u2014deadly poisonous\u2014because of the salts within it. \n    We need salt to live, but only in very small amounts, and seawater contains way more\u2014\nabout seventy times more\u2014salt than we can safely metabolize. A typical liter of seawater will \ncontain only about 2.5 teaspoons of common salt\u2014the kind we sprinkle on food\u2014but much \nlarger amounts of other elements, compounds, and other dissolved solids, which are \ncollectively known as salts. The proportions of these salts and minerals in our tissues is \nuncannily similar to seawater\u2014we sweat and cry seawater, as Margulis and Sagan have put \nit\u2014but curiously we cannot tolerate them as an input. Take a lot of salt into your body and \nyour metabolism very quickly goes into crisis. From every cell, water molecules rush off like \nso many volunteer firemen to try to dilute and carry off the sudden intake of salt. This leaves \nthe cells dangerously short of the water they need to carry out their normal functions. They \nbecome, in a word, dehydrated. In extreme situations, dehydration will lead to seizures, \nunconsciousness, and brain damage. Meanwhile, the overworked blood cells carry the salt to \nthe kidneys, which eventually become overwhelmed and shut down. Without functioning \nkidneys you die. That is why we don\u2019t drink seawater. \n    There are 320 million cubic miles of water on Earth and that is all we\u2019re ever going to get. \nThe system is closed: practically speaking, nothing can be added or subtracted. The water you \ndrink has been around doing its job since the Earth was young. By 3.8 billion years ago, the \noceans had (at least more or less) achieved their present volumes. \n    The water realm is known as the hydrosphere and it is overwhelmingly oceanic. Ninety-\nseven percent of all the water on Earth is in the seas, the greater part of it in the Pacific, which \ncovers half the planet and is bigger than all the landmasses put together. Altogether the \nPacific holds just over half of all the ocean water (51.6 percent to be precise); the Atlantic has \n23.6 percent and the Indian Ocean 21.2 percent, leaving just 3.6 percent to be accounted for \nby all the other seas. The average depth of the ocean is 2.4 miles, with the Pacific on average \nabout a thousand feet deeper than the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Altogether 60 percent of \nthe planet\u2019s surface is ocean more than a mile deep. As Philip Ball notes, we would better call \nour planet not Earth but Water. \n    Of the 3 percent of Earth\u2019s water that is fresh, most exists as ice sheets. Only the tiniest \namount\u20140.036 percent\u2014is found in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, and an even smaller part\u2014\njust 0.001 percent\u2014exists in clouds or as vapor. Nearly 90 percent of the planet\u2019s ice is in \nAntarctica, and most of the rest is in Greenland. Go to the South Pole and you will be \nstanding on nearly two miles of ice, at the North Pole just fifteen feet of it. Antarctica alonehas six million cubic miles of ice\u2014enough to raise the oceans by a height of two hundred feet \nif it all melted. But if all the water in the atmosphere fell as rain, evenly everywhere, the \noceans would deepen by only an inch. \n    Sea level, incidentally, is an almost entirely notional concept. Seas are not level at all. \nTides, winds, the Coriolis force, and other effects alter water levels considerably from one \nocean to another and within oceans as well. The Pacific is about a foot and a half higher along \nits western edge\u2014a consequence of the centrifugal force created by the Earth\u2019s spin. Just as \nwhen you pull on a tub of water the water tends to flow toward the other end, as if reluctant to \ncome with you, so the eastward spin of Earth piles water up against the ocean\u2019s western \nmargins. \n    Considering the age-old importance of the seas to us, it is striking how long it took the \nworld to take a scientific interest in them. Until well into the nineteenth century most of what \nwas known about the oceans was based on what washed ashore or came up in fishing nets, \nand nearly all that was written was based more on anecdote and supposition than on physical \nevidence. In the 1830s, the British naturalist Edward Forbes surveyed ocean beds throughout \nthe Atlantic and Mediterranean and declared that there was no life at all in the seas below \n2,000 feet. It seemed a reasonable assumption. There was no light at that depth, so no plant \nlife, and the pressures of water at such depths were known to be extreme. So it came as \nsomething of a surprise when, in 1860, one of the first transatlantic telegraph cables was \nhauled up for repairs from more than two miles down, and it was found to be thickly \nencrusted with corals, clams, and other living detritus. \n    The first really organized investigation of the seas didn\u2019t come until 1872, when a joint \nexpedition between the British Museum, the Royal Society, and the British government set \nforth from Portsmouth on a former warship called HMS Challenger. For three and a half \nyears they sailed the world, sampling waters, netting fish, and hauling a dredge through \nsediments. It was evidently dreary work. Out of a complement of 240 scientists and crew, one \nin four jumped ship and eight more died or went mad\u2014\u201cdriven to distraction by the mind-\nnumbing routine of years of dredging\u201d in the words of the historian Samantha Weinberg. But \nthey sailed across almost 70,000 nautical miles of sea, collected over 4,700 new species of \nmarine organisms, gathered enough information to create a fifty-volume report (which took \nnineteen years to put together), and gave the world the name of a new scientific discipline: \noceanography. They also discovered, by means of depth measurements, that there appeared to \nbe submerged mountains in the mid-Atlantic, prompting some excited observers to speculate \nthat they had found the lost continent of Atlantis. \n    Because the institutional world mostly ignored the seas, it fell to devoted\u2014and very \noccasional\u2014amateurs to tell us what was down there. Modern deep-water exploration begins \nwith Charles William Beebe and Otis Barton in 1930. Although they were equal partners, the \nmore colorful Beebe has always received far more written attention. Born in 1877 into a well-\nto-do family in New York City, Beebe studied zoology at Columbia University, then took a \njob as a birdkeeper at the New York Zoological Society. Tiring of that, he decided to adopt \nthe life of an adventurer and for the next quarter century traveled extensively through Asia \nand South America with a succession of attractive female assistants whose jobs were \ninventively described as \u201chistorian and technicist\u201d or \u201cassistant in fish problems.\u201d He \nsupported these endeavors with a succession of popular books with titles like Edge of the \nJungle and Jungle Days, though he also produced some respectable books on wildlife and \nornithology.In the mid-1920s, on a trip to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, he discovered \u201cthe delights of \ndangling,\u201d as he described deep-sea diving. Soon afterward he teamed up with Barton, who \ncame from an even wealthier family, had also attended Columbia, and also longed for \nadventure. Although Beebe nearly always gets the credit, it was in fact Barton who designed \nthe first bathysphere (from the Greek word for \u201cdeep\u201d) and funded the $12,000 cost of its \nconstruction. It was a tiny and necessarily robust chamber, made of cast iron 1.5 inches thick \nand with two small portholes containing quartz blocks three inches thick. It held two men, but \nonly if they were prepared to become extremely well acquainted. Even by the standards of the \nage, the technology was unsophisticated. The sphere had no maneuverability\u2014it simply hung \non the end of a long cable\u2014and only the most primitive breathing system: to neutralize their \nown carbon dioxide they set out open cans of soda lime, and to absorb moisture they opened a \nsmall tub of calcium chloride, over which they sometimes waved palm fronds to encourage \nchemical reactions. \n    But the nameless little bathysphere did the job it was intended to do. On the first dive, in \nJune 1930 in the Bahamas, Barton and Beebe set a world record by descending to 600 feet. By \n1934, they had pushed the record to 3,028 feet, where it would stay until after the war. Barton \nwas confident the device was safe to a depth of 4,500 feet, though the strain on every bolt and \nrivet was audibly evident with each fathom they descended. At any depth, it was brave and \nrisky work. At 3,000 feet, their little porthole was subjected to nineteen tons of pressure per \nsquare inch. Death at such a depth would have been instantaneous, as Beebe never failed to \nobserve in his many books, articles, and radio broadcasts. Their main concern, however, was \nthat the shipboard winch, straining to hold on to a metal ball and two tons of steel cable, \nwould snap and send the two men plunging to the seafloor. In such an event, nothing could \nhave saved them. \n    The one thing their descents didn\u2019t produce was a great deal of worthwhile science. \nAlthough they encountered many creatures that had not been seen before, the limits of \nvisibility and the fact that neither of the intrepid aquanauts was a trained oceanographer meant \nthey often weren\u2019t able to describe their findings in the kind of detail that real scientists \ncraved. The sphere didn\u2019t carry an external light, merely a 250-watt bulb they could hold up \nto the window, but the water below five hundred feet was practically impenetrable anyway, \nand they were peering into it through three inches of quartz, so anything they hoped to view \nwould have to be nearly as interested in them as they were in it. About all they could report, in \nconsequence, was that there were a lot of strange things down there. On one dive in 1934, \nBeebe was startled to spy a giant serpent \u201cmore than twenty feet long and very wide.\u201d It \npassed too swiftly to be more than a shadow. Whatever it was, nothing like it has been seen \nby anyone since. Because of such vagueness their reports were generally ignored by \nacademics. \n    After their record-breaking descent of 1934, Beebe lost interest in diving and moved on to \nother adventures, but Barton persevered. To his credit, Beebe always told anyone who asked \nthat Barton was the real brains behind the enterprise, but Barton seemed unable to step from \nthe shadows. He, too, wrote thrilling accounts of their underwater adventures and even starred \nin a Hollywood movie called Titans of the Deep, featuring a bathysphere and many exciting \nand largely fictionalized encounters with aggressive giant squid and the like. He even \nadvertised Camel cigarettes (\u201cThey don\u2019t give me jittery nerves\u201d). In 1948 he increased the \ndepth record by 50 percent, with a dive to 4,500 feet in the Pacific Ocean near California, but \nthe world seemed determined to overlook him. One newspaper reviewer of Titans of the Deep \nactually thought the star of the film was Beebe. Nowadays, Barton is lucky to get a mention.At all events, he was about to be comprehensively eclipsed by a father-and-son team from \nSwitzerland, Auguste and Jacques Piccard, who were designing a new type of probe called a \nbathyscaphe (meaning \u201cdeep boat\u201d). Christened Trieste, after the Italian city in which it was \nbuilt, the new device maneuvered independently, though it did little more than just go up and \ndown. On one of its first dives, in early 1954, it descended to below 13,287 feet, nearly three \ntimes Barton\u2019s record-breaking dive of six years earlier. But deep-sea dives required a great \ndeal of costly support, and the Piccards were gradually going broke. \n    In 1958, they did a deal with the U.S. Navy, which gave the Navy ownership but left them \nin control. Now flush with funds, the Piccards rebuilt the vessel, giving it walls five inches \nthick and shrinking the windows to just two inches in diameter\u2014little more than peepholes. \nBut it was now strong enough to withstand truly enormous pressures, and in January 1960 \nJacques Piccard and Lieutenant Don Walsh of the U.S. Navy sank slowly to the bottom of the \nocean\u2019s deepest canyon, the Mariana Trench, some 250 miles off Guam in the western Pacific \n(and discovered, not incidentally, by Harry Hess with his fathometer). It took just under four \nhours to fall 35,820 feet, or almost seven miles. Although the pressure at that depth was \nnearly 17,000 pounds per square inch, they noticed with surprise that they disturbed a bottom-\ndwelling flatfish just as they touched down. They had no facilities for taking photographs, so \nthere is no visual record of the event. \n    After just twenty minutes at the world\u2019s deepest point, they returned to the surface. It was \nthe only occasion on which human beings have gone so deep. \n    Forty years later, the question that naturally occurs is: Why has no one gone back since? To \nbegin with, further dives were vigorously opposed by Vice Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, a \nman who had a lively temperament, forceful views, and, most pertinently, control of the \ndepartmental checkbook. He thought underwater exploration a waste of resources and pointed \nout that the Navy was not a research institute. The nation, moreover, was about to become \nfully preoccupied with space travel and the quest to send a man to the Moon, which made \ndeep sea investigations seem unimportant and rather old-fashioned. But the decisive \nconsideration was that the Trieste descent didn\u2019t actually achieve much. As a Navy official \nexplained years later: \u201cWe didn\u2019t learn a hell of a lot from it, other than that we could do it. \nWhy do it again?\u201d It was, in short, a long way to go to find a flatfish, and expensive too. \nRepeating the exercise today, it has been estimated, would cost at least $100 million. \n    When underwater researchers realized that the Navy had no intention of pursuing a \npromised exploration program, there was a pained outcry. Partly to placate its critics, the \nNavy provided funding for a more advanced submersible, to be operated by the Woods Hole \nOceanographic Institution of Massachusetts. Called Alvin, in somewhat contracted honor of \nthe oceanographer Allyn C. Vine, it would be a fully maneuverable minisubmarine, though it \nwouldn\u2019t go anywhere near as deep as the Trieste. There was just one problem: the designers \ncouldn\u2019t find anyone willing to build it. According to William J. Broad in The Universe \nBelow: \u201cNo big company like General Dynamics, which made submarines for the Navy, \nwanted to take on a project disparaged by both the Bureau of Ships and Admiral Rickover, the \ngods of naval patronage.\u201d Eventually, not to say improbably, Alvin was constructed by \nGeneral Mills, the food company, at a factory where it made the machines to produce \nbreakfast cereals. \n    As for what else was down there, people really had very little idea. Well into the 1950s, the \nbest maps available to oceanographers were overwhelmingly based on a little detail from \nscattered surveys going back to 1929 grafted onto, essentially an ocean of guesswork. TheNavy had excellent charts with which to guide submarines through canyons and around \nguyots, but it didn\u2019t wish such information to fall into Soviet hands, so it kept its knowledge \nclassified. Academics therefore had to make do with sketchy and antiquated surveys or rely \non hopeful surmise. Even today our knowledge of the ocean floors remains remarkably low \nresolution. If you look at the Moon with a standard backyard telescope you will see \nsubstantial craters\u2014Fracastorious, Blancanus, Zach, Planck, and many others familiar to any \nlunar scientist\u2014that would be unknown if they were on our own ocean floors. We have better \nmaps of Mars than we do of our own seabeds. \n    At the surface level, investigative techniques have also been a trifle ad hoc. In 1994, thirty-\nfour thousand ice hockey gloves were swept overboard from a Korean cargo ship during a \nstorm in the Pacific. The gloves washed up all over, from Vancouver to Vietnam, helping \noceanographers to trace currents more accurately than they ever had before. \n    Today Alvin is nearly forty years old, but it still remains America\u2019s premier research vessel. \nThere are still no submersibles that can go anywhere near the depth of the Mariana Trench \nand only five, including Alvin, that can reach the depths of the \u201cabyssal plain\u201d\u2014the deep \nocean floor\u2014that covers more than half the planet\u2019s surface. A typical submersible costs \nabout $25,000 a day to operate, so they are hardly dropped into the water on a whim, still less \nput to sea in the hope that they will randomly stumble on something of interest. It\u2019s rather as \nif our firsthand experience of the surface world were based on the work of five guys exploring \non garden tractors after dark. According to Robert Kunzig, humans may have scrutinized \n\u201cperhaps a millionth or a billionth of the sea\u2019s darkness. Maybe less. Maybe much less.\u201d \n    But oceanographers are nothing if not industrious, and they have made several important \ndiscoveries with their limited resources\u2014including, in 1977, one of the most important and \nstartling biological discoveries of the twentieth century. In that year Alvin found teeming \ncolonies of large organisms living on and around deep-sea vents off the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\u2014\ntube worms over ten feet long, clams a foot wide, shrimps and mussels in profusion, \nwriggling spaghetti worms. They all owed their existence to vast colonies of bacteria that \nwere deriving their energy and sustenance from hydrogen sulfides\u2014compounds profoundly \ntoxic to surface creatures\u2014that were pouring steadily from the vents. It was a world \nindependent of sunlight, oxygen, or anything else normally associated with life. This was a \nliving system based not on photosynthesis but on chemosynthesis, an arrangement that \nbiologists would have dismissed as preposterous had anyone been imaginative enough to \nsuggest it. \n    Huge amounts of heat and energy flow from these vents. Two dozen of them together will \nproduce as much energy as a large power station, and the range of temperatures around them \nis enormous. The temperature at the point of outflow can be as much as 760 degrees \nFahrenheit, while a few feet away the water may be only two or three degrees above freezing. \nA type of worm called an alvinellid was found living right on the margins, with the water \ntemperature 140 degrees warmer at its head than at its tail. Before this it had been thought that \nno complex organisms could survive in water warmer than about 130 degrees, and here was \none that was surviving warmer temperatures than that and extreme cold to boot. The \ndiscovery transformed our understanding of the requirements for life. \n    It also answered one of the great puzzles of oceanography\u2014something that many of us \ndidn\u2019t realize was a puzzle\u2014namely, why the oceans don\u2019t grow saltier with time. At the risk \nof stating the obvious, there is a lot of salt in the sea\u2014enough to bury every bit of land on the \nplanet to a depth of about five hundred feet. Millions of gallons of fresh water evaporate fromthe ocean daily, leaving all their salts behind, so logically the seas ought to grow more salty \nwith the passing years, but they don\u2019t. Something takes an amount of salt out of the water \nequivalent to the amount being put in. For the longest time, no one could figure out what \ncould be responsible for this. \n    Alvin\u2019s discovery of the deep-sea vents provided the answer. Geophysicists realized that the \nvents were acting much like the filters in a fish tank. As water is taken down into the crust, \nsalts are stripped from it, and eventually clean water is blown out again through the chimney \nstacks. The process is not swift\u2014it can take up to ten million years to clean an ocean\u2014but it \nis marvelously efficient as long as you are not in a hurry. \n  \n    Perhaps nothing speaks more clearly of our psychological remoteness from the ocean \ndepths than that the main expressed goal for oceanographers during International Geophysical \nYear of 1957\u201358 was to study \u201cthe use of ocean depths for the dumping of radioactive \nwastes.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a secret assignment, you understand, but a proud public boast. In fact, \nthough it wasn\u2019t much publicized, by 1957\u201358 the dumping of radioactive wastes had already \nbeen going on, with a certain appalling vigor, for over a decade. Since 1946, the United States \nhad been ferrying fifty-five-gallon drums of radioactive gunk out to the Farallon Islands, \nsome thirty miles off the California coast near San Francisco, where it simply threw them \noverboard. \n    It was all quite extraordinarily sloppy. Most of the drums were exactly the sort you see \nrusting behind gas stations or standing outside factories, with no protective linings of any \ntype. When they failed to sink, which was usually, Navy gunners riddled them with bullets to \nlet water in (and, of course, plutonium, uranium, and strontium out). Before it was halted in \nthe 1990s, the United States had dumped many hundreds of thousands of drums into about \nfifty ocean sites\u2014almost fifty thousand of them in the Farallons alone. But the U.S. was by no \nmeans alone. Among the other enthusiastic dumpers were Russia, China, Japan, New Zealand, \nand nearly all the nations of Europe. \n    And what effect might all this have had on life beneath the seas? Well, little, we hope, but \nwe actually have no idea. We are astoundingly, sumptuously, radiantly ignorant of life \nbeneath the seas. Even the most substantial ocean creatures are often remarkably little known \nto us\u2014including the most mighty of them all, the great blue whale, a creature of such \nleviathan proportions that (to quote David Attenborough) its \u201ctongue weighs as much as an \nelephant, its heart is the size of a car and some of its blood vessels are so wide that you could \nswim down them.\u201d It is the most gargantuan beast that Earth has yet produced, bigger even \nthan the most cumbrous dinosaurs. Yet the lives of blue whales are largely a mystery to us. \nMuch of the time we have no idea where they are\u2014where they go to breed, for instance, or \nwhat routes they follow to get there. What little we know of them comes almost entirely from \neavesdropping on their songs, but even these are a mystery. Blue whales will sometimes break \noff a song, then pick it up again at the same spot six months later. Sometimes they strike up \nwith a new song, which no member can have heard before but which each already knows. \nHow they do this is not remotely understood. And these are animals that must routinely come \nto the surface to breathe. \n    For animals that need never surface, obscurity can be even more tantalizing. Consider the \nfabled giant squid. Though nothing on the scale of the blue whale, it is a decidedly substantial \nanimal, with eyes the size of soccer balls and trailing tentacles that can reach lengths of sixtyfeet. It weighs nearly a ton and is Earth\u2019s largest invertebrate. If you dumped one in a normal \nhousehold swimming pool, there wouldn\u2019t be much room for anything else. Yet no scientist\u2014\nno person as far as we know\u2014has ever seen a giant squid alive. Zoologists have devoted \ncareers to trying to capture, or just glimpse, living giant squid and have always failed. They \nare known mostly from being washed up on beaches\u2014particularly, for unknown reasons, the \nbeaches of the South Island of New Zealand. They must exist in large numbers because they \nform a central part of the sperm whale\u2019s diet, and sperm whales take a lot of feeding.1  \n    According to one estimate, there could be as many as thirty million species of animals \nliving in the sea, most still undiscovered. The first hint of how abundant life is in the deep \nseas didn\u2019t come until as recently as the 1960s with the invention of the epibenthic sled, a \ndredging device that captures organisms not just on and near the seafloor but also buried in \nthe sediments beneath. In a single one-hour trawl along the continental shelf, at a depth of just \nunder a mile, Woods Hole oceanographers Howard Sandler and Robert Hessler netted over \n25,000 creatures\u2014worms, starfish, sea cucumbers, and the like\u2014representing 365 species. \nEven at a depth of three miles, they found some 3,700 creatures representing almost 200 \nspecies of organism. But the dredge could only capture things that were too slow or stupid to \nget out of the way. In the late 1960s a marine biologist named John Isaacs got the idea to \nlower a camera with bait attached to it, and found still more, in particular dense swarms of \nwrithing hagfish, a primitive eel-like creature, as well as darting shoals of grenadier fish. \nWhere a good food source is suddenly available\u2014for instance, when a whale dies and sinks to \nthe bottom\u2014as many as 390 species of marine creature have been found dining off it. \nInterestingly, many of these creatures were found to have come from vents up to a thousand \nmiles distant. These included such types as mussels and clams, which are hardly known as \ngreat travelers. It is now thought that the larvae of certain organisms may drift through the \nwater until, by some unknown chemical means, they detect that they have arrived at a food \nopportunity and fall onto it. \n  \n    So why, if the seas are so vast, do we so easily overtax them? Well, to begin with, the \nworld\u2019s seas are not uniformly bounteous. Altogether less than a tenth of the ocean is \nconsidered naturally productive. Most aquatic species like to be in shallow waters where there \nis warmth and light and an abundance of organic matter to prime the food chain. Coral reefs, \nfor instance, constitute well under 1 percent of the ocean\u2019s space but are home to about 25 \npercent of its fish. \nElsewhere, the oceans aren\u2019t nearly so rich. Take Australia. With over 20,000 miles of \ncoastline and almost nine million square miles of territorial waters, it has more sea lapping its \nshores than any other country, yet, as Tim Flannery notes, it doesn\u2019t even make it into the top \nfifty among fishing nations. Indeed, Australia is a large net importer of seafood. This is \nbecause much of Australia\u2019s waters are, like much of Australia itself, essentially desert. (A \nnotable exception is the Great Barrier Reef off Queensland, which is sumptuously fecund.) \nBecause the soil is poor, it produces little in the way of nutrient-rich runoff. \nEven where life thrives, it is often extremely sensitive to disturbance. In the 1970s, fishermen \nfrom Australia and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand discovered shoals of a little-known fish \nliving at a depth of about half a mile on their continental shelves. They were known as orange \n                                                 \n1 The indigestible parts of giant squid, in particular their beaks, accumulate in sperm whales' stomachs into the \nsubstance known as ambergris, which is used as a fixative in perfumes. The next time you spray on Chanel No. 5 \n(assuming you do), you may wish to reflect that you are dousing yourself in distillate of unseen sea monster.roughy, they were delicious, and they existed in huge numbers. In no time at all, fishing fleets \nwere hauling in forty thousand metric tons of roughy a year. Then marine biologists made \nsome alarming discoveries. Roughy are extremely long lived and slow maturing. Some may \nbe 150 years old; any roughy you have eaten may well have been born when Victoria was \nQueen. Roughy have adopted this exceedingly unhurried lifestyle because the waters they live \nin are so resource-poor. In such waters, some fish spawn just once in a lifetime. Clearly these \nare populations that cannot stand a great deal of disturbance. Unfortunately, by the time this \nwas realized the stocks had been severely depleted. Even with careful management it will be \ndecades before the populations recover, if they ever do. \n    Elsewhere, however, the misuse of the oceans has been more wanton than inadvertent. \nMany fishermen \u201cfin\u201d sharks\u2014that is, slice their fins off, then dump them back into the water \nto die. In 1998, shark fins sold in the Far East for over $250 a pound. A bowl of shark fin \nsoup retailed in Tokyo for $100. The World Wildlife Fund estimated in 1994 that the number \nof sharks killed each year was between 40 million and 70 million. \n    As of 1995, some 37,000 industrial-sized fishing ships, plus about a million smaller boats, \nwere between them taking twice as many fish from the sea as they had just twenty-five years \nearlier. Trawlers are sometimes now as big as cruise ships and haul behind them nets big \nenough to hold a dozen jumbo jets. Some even use spotter planes to locate shoals of fish from \nthe air. \n    It is estimated that about a quarter of every fishing net hauled up contains \u201cby-catch\u201d\u2014fish \nthat can\u2019t be landed because they are too small or of the wrong type or caught in the wrong \nseason. As one observer told the Economist: \u201cWe\u2019re still in the Dark Ages. We just drop a net \ndown and see what comes up.\u201d Perhaps as much as twenty-two million metric tons of such \nunwanted fish are dumped back in the sea each year, mostly in the form of corpses. For every \npound of shrimp harvested, about four pounds of fish and other marine creatures are \ndestroyed. \n    Large areas of the North Sea floor are dragged clean by beam trawlers as many as seven \ntimes a year, a degree of disturbance that no ecosystem can withstand. At least two-thirds of \nspecies in the North Sea, by many estimates, are being overfished. Across the Atlantic things \nare no better. Halibut once abounded in such numbers off New England that individual boats \ncould land twenty thousand pounds of it in a day. Now halibut is all but extinct off the \nnortheast coast of North America. \n    Nothing, however, compares with the fate of cod. In the late fifteenth century, the explorer \nJohn Cabot found cod in incredible numbers on the eastern banks of North America\u2014shallow \nareas of water popular with bottom-feeding fish like cod. Some of these banks were vast. \nGeorges Banks off Massachusetts is bigger than the state it abuts. The Grand Banks off \nNewfoundland is bigger still and for centuries was always dense with cod. They were thought \nto be inexhaustible. Of course they were anything but. \n    By 1960, the number of spawning cod in the north Atlantic had fallen to an estimated 1.6 \nmillion metric tons. By 1990 this had sunk to 22,000 metric tons. In commercial terms, the \ncod were extinct. \u201cFishermen,\u201d wrote Mark Kurlansky in his fascinating history, Cod, \u201chad \ncaught them all.\u201d The cod may have lost the western Atlantic forever. In 1992, cod fishing \nwas stopped altogether on the Grand Banks, but as of last autumn, according to a report in \nNature, stocks had not staged a comeback. Kurlansky notes that the fish of fish fillets and fishsticks was originally cod, but then was replaced by haddock, then by redfish, and lately by \nPacific pollock. These days, he notes drily, \u201cfish\u201d is \u201cwhatever is left.\u201d \n    Much the same can be said of many other seafoods. In the New England fisheries off \nRhode Island, it was once routine to haul in lobsters weighing twenty pounds. Sometimes they \nreached thirty pounds. Left unmolested, lobsters can live for decades\u2014as much as seventy \nyears, it is thought\u2014and they never stop growing. Nowadays few lobsters weigh more than \ntwo pounds on capture. \u201cBiologists,\u201d according to the New York Times, \u201cestimate that 90 \npercent of lobsters are caught within a year after they reach the legal minimum size at about \nage six.\u201d Despite declining catches, New England fishermen continue to receive state and \nfederal tax incentives that encourage them\u2014in some cases all but compel them\u2014to acquire \nbigger boats and to harvest the seas more intensively. Today fishermen of Massachusetts are \nreduced to fishing the hideous hagfish, for which there is a slight market in the Far East, but \neven their numbers are now falling. \n    We are remarkably ignorant of the dynamics that rule life in the sea. While marine life is \npoorer than it ought to be in areas that have been overfished, in some naturally impoverished \nwaters there is far more life than there ought to be. The southern oceans around Antarctica \nproduce only about 3 percent of the world\u2019s phytoplankton\u2014far too little, it would seem, to \nsupport a complex ecosystem, and yet it does. Crab-eater seals are not a species of animal that \nmost of us have heard of, but they may actually be the second most numerous large species of \nanimal on Earth, after humans. As many as fifteen million of them may live on the pack ice \naround Antarctica. There are also perhaps two million Weddel seals, at least half a million \nemperor penguins, and maybe as many as four million Ad\u00e9lie penguins. The food chain is \nthus hopelessly top heavy, but somehow it works. Remarkably no one knows how. \n    All this is a very roundabout way of making the point that we know very little about Earth\u2019s \nbiggest system. But then, as we shall see in the pages remaining to us, once you start talking \nabout life, there is a great deal we don\u2019t know, not least how it got going in the first place.", "19": "19    THE RISE OF LIFE \n \n \n \nIN 1953, STANLEY Miller, a graduate student at the University of Chicago, took two \nflasks\u2014one containing a little water to represent a primeval ocean, the other holding a \nmixture of methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulphide gases to represent Earth\u2019s early \natmosphere\u2014connected them with rubber tubes, and introduced some electrical sparks as a \nstand-in for lightning. After a few days, the water in the flasks had turned green and yellow in \na hearty broth of amino acids, fatty acids, sugars, and other organic compounds. \u201cIf God \ndidn\u2019t do it this way,\u201d observed Miller\u2019s delighted supervisor, the Nobel laureate Harold \nUrey, \u201cHe missed a good bet.\u201d \n    Press reports of the time made it sound as if about all that was needed now was for \nsomebody to give the whole a good shake and life would crawl out. As time has shown, it \nwasn\u2019t nearly so simple. Despite half a century of further study, we are no nearer to \nsynthesizing life today than we were in 1953 and much further away from thinking we can. \nScientists are now pretty certain that the early atmosphere was nothing like as primed for \ndevelopment as Miller and Urey\u2019s gaseous stew, but rather was a much less reactive blend of \nnitrogen and carbon dioxide. Repeating Miller\u2019s experiments with these more challenging \ninputs has so far produced only one fairly primitive amino acid. At all events, creating amino \nacids is not really the problem. The problem is proteins. \n    Proteins are what you get when you string amino acids together, and we need a lot of them. \nNo one really knows, but there may be as many as a million types of protein in the human \nbody, and each one is a little miracle. By all the laws of probability proteins shouldn\u2019t exist. \nTo make a protein you need to assemble amino acids (which I am obliged by long tradition to \nrefer to here as \u201cthe building blocks of life\u201d) in a particular order, in much the same way that \nyou assemble letters in a particular order to spell a word. The problem is that words in the \namino acid alphabet are often exceedingly long. To spell collagen, the name of a common \ntype of protein, you need to arrange eight letters in the right order. But to make collagen, you \nneed to arrange 1,055 amino acids in precisely the right sequence. But\u2014and here\u2019s an \nobvious but crucial point\u2014you don\u2019t make it. It makes itself, spontaneously, without \ndirection, and this is where the unlikelihoods come in. \n    The chances of a 1,055-sequence molecule like collagen spontaneously self-assembling are, \nfrankly, nil. It just isn\u2019t going to happen. To grasp what a long shot its existence is, visualize a \nstandard Las Vegas slot machine but broadened greatly\u2014to about ninety feet, to be precise\u2014\nto accommodate 1,055 spinning wheels instead of the usual three or four, and with twenty \nsymbols on each wheel (one for each common amino acid).1 How long would you have to \npull the handle before all 1,055 symbols came up in the right order? Effectively forever. Even \nif you reduced the number of spinning wheels to two hundred, which is actually a more \ntypical number of amino acids for a protein, the odds against all two hundred coming up in a \n                                                 \n1 There are actually twenty-two naturally occurring amino acids known on Earth, and more may await discovery, \nbut only twenty of them are necessary to produce us and most other living things. The twenty-second, called \npyrrolysine, was discovered in 2002 by researchers at Ohio State University and is found only in a single type of \narchaean (a basic form of life that we will discuss a little further on in the story) called Methanosarcina barkeri.prescribed sequence are 1 in 10260(that is a 1 followed by 260 zeroes). That in itself is a larger \nnumber than all the atoms in the universe. \n    Proteins, in short, are complex entities. Hemoglobin is only 146 amino acids long, a runt by \nprotein standards, yet even it offers 10190possible amino acid combinations, which is why it \ntook the Cambridge University chemist Max Perutz twenty-three years\u2014a career, more or \nless\u2014to unravel it. For random events to produce even a single protein would seem a \nstunning improbability\u2014like a whirlwind spinning through a junkyard and leaving behind a \nfully assembled jumbo jet, in the colorful simile of the astronomer Fred Hoyle. \n    Yet we are talking about several hundred thousand types of protein, perhaps a million, each \nunique and each, as far as we know, vital to the maintenance of a sound and happy you. And \nit goes on from there. A protein to be of use must not only assemble amino acids in the right \nsequence, but then must engage in a kind of chemical origami and fold itself into a very \nspecific shape. Even having achieved this structural complexity, a protein is no good to you if \nit can\u2019t reproduce itself, and proteins can\u2019t. For this you need DNA. DNA is a whiz at \nreplicating\u2014it can make a copy of itself in seconds\u2014but can do virtually nothing else. So we \nhave a paradoxical situation. Proteins can\u2019t exist without DNA, and DNA has no purpose \nwithout proteins. Are we to assume then that they arose simultaneously with the purpose of \nsupporting each other? If so: wow. \n    And there is more still. DNA, proteins, and the other components of life couldn\u2019t prosper \nwithout some sort of membrane to contain them. No atom or molecule has ever achieved life \nindependently. Pluck any atom from your body, and it is no more alive than is a grain of sand. \nIt is only when they come together within the nurturing refuge of a cell that these diverse \nmaterials can take part in the amazing dance that we call life. Without the cell, they are \nnothing more than interesting chemicals. But without the chemicals, the cell has no purpose. \nAs the physicist Paul Davies puts it, \u201cIf everything needs everything else, how did the \ncommunity of molecules ever arise in the first place?\u201d It is rather as if all the ingredients in \nyour kitchen somehow got together and baked themselves into a cake\u2014but a cake that could \nmoreover divide when necessary to produce more cakes. It is little wonder that we call it the \nmiracle of life. It is also little wonder that we have barely begun to understand it. \n  \n    So what accounts for all this wondrous complexity? Well, one possibility is that perhaps it \nisn\u2019t quite\u2014not quite\u2014so wondrous as at first it seems. Take those amazingly improbable \nproteins. The wonder we see in their assembly comes in assuming that they arrived on the \nscene fully formed. But what if the protein chains didn\u2019t assemble all at once? What if, in the \ngreat slot machine of creation, some of the wheels could be held, as a gambler might hold a \nnumber of promising cherries? What if, in other words, proteins didn\u2019t suddenly burst into \nbeing, but evolved . \n    Imagine if you took all the components that make up a human being\u2014carbon, hydrogen, \noxygen, and so on\u2014and put them in a container with some water, gave it a vigorous stir, and \nout stepped a completed person. That would be amazing. Well, that\u2019s essentially what Hoyle \nand others (including many ardent creationists) argue when they suggest that proteins \nspontaneously formed all at once. They didn\u2019t\u2014they can\u2019t have. As Richard Dawkins argues \nin The Blind Watchmaker, there must have been some kind of cumulative selection process \nthat allowed amino acids to assemble in chunks. Perhaps two or three amino acids linked upfor some simple purpose and then after a time bumped into some other similar small cluster \nand in so doing \u201cdiscovered\u201d some additional improvement. \n    Chemical reactions of the sort associated with life are actually something of a \ncommonplace. It may be beyond us to cook them up in a lab, \u00e0 la Stanley Miller and Harold \nUrey, but the universe does it readily enough. Lots of molecules in nature get together to form \nlong chains called polymers. Sugars constantly assemble to form starches. Crystals can do a \nnumber of lifelike things\u2014replicate, respond to environmental stimuli, take on a patterned \ncomplexity. They\u2019ve never achieved life itself, of course, but they demonstrate repeatedly that \ncomplexity is a natural, spontaneous, entirely commonplace event. There may or may not be a \ngreat deal of life in the universe at large, but there is no shortage of ordered self-assembly, in \neverything from the transfixing symmetry of snowflakes to the comely rings of Saturn. \n    So powerful is this natural impulse to assemble that many scientists now believe that life \nmay be more inevitable than we think\u2014that it is, in the words of the Belgian biochemist and \nNobel laureate Christian de Duve, \u201can obligatory manifestation of matter, bound to arise \nwherever conditions are appropriate.\u201d De Duve thought it likely that such conditions would be \nencountered perhaps a million times in every galaxy. \n    Certainly there is nothing terribly exotic in the chemicals that animate us. If you wished to \ncreate another living object, whether a goldfish or a head of lettuce or a human being, you \nwould need really only four principal elements, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, plus \nsmall amounts of a few others, principally sulfur, phosphorus, calcium, and iron. Put these \ntogether in three dozen or so combinations to form some sugars, acids, and other basic \ncompounds and you can build anything that lives. As Dawkins notes: \u201cThere is nothing \nspecial about the substances from which living things are made. Living things are collections \nof molecules, like everything else.\u201d \n    The bottom line is that life is amazing and gratifying, perhaps even miraculous, but hardly \nimpossible\u2014as we repeatedly attest with our own modest existences. To be sure, many of the \ndetails of life\u2019s beginnings remain pretty imponderable. Every scenario you have ever read \nconcerning the conditions necessary for life involves water\u2014from the \u201cwarm little pond\u201d \nwhere Darwin supposed life began to the bubbling sea vents that are now the most popular \ncandidates for life\u2019s beginnings\u2014but all this overlooks the fact that to turn monomers into \npolymers (which is to say, to begin to create proteins) involves what is known to biology as \n\u201cdehydration linkages.\u201d As one leading biology text puts it, with perhaps just a tiny hint of \ndiscomfort, \u201cResearchers agree that such reactions would not have been energetically \nfavorable in the primitive sea, or indeed in any aqueous medium, because of the mass action \nlaw.\u201d It is a little like putting sugar in a glass of water and having it become a cube. It \nshouldn\u2019t happen, but somehow in nature it does. The actual chemistry of all this is a little \narcane for our purposes here, but it is enough to know that if you make monomers wet they \ndon\u2019t turn into polymers\u2014except when creating life on Earth. How and why it happens then \nand not otherwise is one of biology\u2019s great unanswered questions. \n    One of the biggest surprises in the earth sciences in recent decades was the discovery of \njust how early in Earth\u2019s history life arose. Well into the 1950s, it was thought that life was \nless than 600 million years old. By the 1970s, a few adventurous souls felt that maybe it went \nback 2.5 billion years. But the present date of 3.85 billion years is stunningly early. Earth\u2019s \nsurface didn\u2019t become solid until about 3.9 billion years ago.\u201cWe can only infer from this rapidity that it is not \u2018difficult\u2019 for life of bacterial grade to \nevolve on planets with appropriate conditions,\u201d Stephen Jay Gould observed in the New York \nTimes in 1996. Or as he put it elsewhere, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that \u201clife, arising as \nsoon as it could, was chemically destined to be.\u201d \n    Life emerged so swiftly, in fact, that some authorities think it must have had help\u2014perhaps \na good deal of help. The idea that earthly life might have arrived from space has a surprisingly \nlong and even occasionally distinguished history. The great Lord Kelvin himself raised the \npossibility as long ago as 1871 at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of \nScience when he suggested that \u201cthe germs of life might have been brought to the earth by \nsome meteorite.\u201d But it remained little more than a fringe notion until one Sunday in \nSeptember 1969 when tens of thousands of Australians were startled by a series of sonic \nbooms and the sight of a fireball streaking from east to west across the sky. The fireball made \na strange crackling sound as it passed and left behind a smell that some likened to methylated \nspirits and others described as just awful. \n    The fireball exploded above Murchison, a town of six hundred people in the Goulburn \nValley north of Melbourne, and came raining down in chunks, some weighing up to twelve \npounds. Fortunately, no one was hurt. The meteorite was of a rare type known as a \ncarbonaceous chondrite, and the townspeople helpfully collected and brought in some two \nhundred pounds of it. The timing could hardly have been better. Less than two months earlier, \nthe Apollo 11 astronauts had returned to Earth with a bag full of lunar rocks, so labs \nthroughout the world were geared up\u2014indeed clamoring\u2014for rocks of extraterrestrial origin. \n    The Murchison meteorite was found to be 4.5 billion years old, and it was studded with \namino acids\u2014seventy-four types in all, eight of which are involved in the formation of earthly \nproteins. In late 2001, more than thirty years after it crashed, a team at the Ames Research \nCenter in California announced that the Murchison rock also contained complex strings of \nsugars called polyols, which had not been found off the Earth before. \n    A few other carbonaceous chondrites have strayed into Earth\u2019s path since\u2014one that landed \nnear Tagish Lake in Canada\u2019s Yukon in January 2000 was seen over large parts of North \nAmerica\u2014and they have likewise confirmed that the universe is actually rich in organic \ncompounds. Halley\u2019s comet, it is now thought, is about 25 percent organic molecules. Get \nenough of those crashing into a suitable place\u2014Earth, for instance\u2014and you have the basic \nelements you need for life. \n    There are two problems with notions of panspermia, as extraterrestrial theories are known. \nThe first is that it doesn\u2019t answer any questions about how life arose, but merely moves \nresponsibility for it elsewhere. The other is that panspermia sometimes excites even the most \nrespectable adherents to levels of speculation that can be safely called imprudent. Francis \nCrick, codiscoverer of the structure of DNA, and his colleague Leslie Orgel have suggested \nthat Earth was \u201cdeliberately seeded with life by intelligent aliens,\u201d an idea that Gribbin calls \n\u201cat the very fringe of scientific respectability\u201d\u2014or, put another way, a notion that would be \nconsidered wildly lunatic if not voiced by a Nobel laureate. Fred Hoyle and his colleague \nChandra Wickramasinghe further eroded enthusiasm for panspermia by suggesting that outer \nspace brought us not only life but also many diseases such as flu and bubonic plague, ideas \nthat were easily disproved by biochemists. Hoyle\u2014and it seems necessary to insert a \nreminder here that he was one of the great scientific minds of the twentieth century\u2014also \nonce suggested, as mentioned earlier, that our noses evolved with the nostrils underneath as a \nway of keeping cosmic pathogens from falling into them as they drifted down from space.Whatever prompted life to begin, it happened just once. That is the most extraordinary fact \nin biology, perhaps the most extraordinary fact we know. Everything that has ever lived, plant \nor animal, dates its beginnings from the same primordial twitch. At some point in an \nunimaginably distant past some little bag of chemicals fidgeted to life. It absorbed some \nnutrients, gently pulsed, had a brief existence. This much may have happened before, perhaps \nmany times. But this ancestral packet did something additional and extraordinary: it cleaved \nitself and produced an heir. A tiny bundle of genetic material passed from one living entity to \nanother, and has never stopped moving since. It was the moment of creation for us all. \nBiologists sometimes call it the Big Birth. \n    \u201cWherever you go in the world, whatever animal, plant, bug, or blob you look at, if it is \nalive, it will use the same dictionary and know the same code. All life is one,\u201d says Matt \nRidley. We are all the result of a single genetic trick handed down from generation to \ngeneration nearly four billion years, to such an extent that you can take a fragment of human \ngenetic instruction, patch it into a faulty yeast cell, and the yeast cell will put it to work as if it \nwere its own. In a very real sense, it is its own. \n  \n    The dawn of life\u2014or something very like it\u2014sits on a shelf in the office of a friendly \nisotope geochemist named Victoria Bennett in the Earth Sciences building of the Australian \nNational University in Canberra. An American, Ms. Bennett came to the ANU from \nCalifornia on a two-year contract in 1989 and has been there ever since. When I visited her, in \nlate 2001, she handed me a modestly hefty hunk of rock composed of thin alternating stripes \nof white quartz and a gray-green material called clinopyroxene. The rock came from Akilia \nIsland in Greenland, where unusually ancient rocks were found in 1997. The rocks are 3.85 \nbillion years old and represent the oldest marine sediments ever found. \n    \u201cWe can\u2019t be certain that what you are holding once contained living organisms because \nyou\u2019d have to pulverize it to find out,\u201d Bennett told me. \u201cBut it comes from the same deposit \nwhere the oldest life was excavated, so it probably had life in it.\u201d Nor would you find actual \nfossilized microbes, however carefully you searched. Any simple organisms, alas, would have \nbeen baked away by the processes that turned ocean mud to stone. Instead what we would see \nif we crunched up the rock and examined it microscopically would be the chemical residues \nthat the organisms left behind\u2014carbon isotopes and a type of phosphate called apatite, which \ntogether provide strong evidence that the rock once contained colonies of living things. \u201cWe \ncan only guess what the organism might have looked like,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIt was probably \nabout as basic as life can get\u2014but it was life nonetheless. It lived. It propagated.\u201d \n    And eventually it led to us. \n    If you are into very old rocks, and Bennett indubitably is, the ANU has long been a prime \nplace to be. This is largely thanks to the ingenuity of a man named Bill Compston, who is \nnow retired but in the 1970s built the world\u2019s first Sensitive High Resolution Ion Micro \nProbe\u2014or SHRIMP, as it is more affectionately known from its initial letters. This is a \nmachine that measures the decay rate of uranium in tiny minerals called zircons. Zircons \nappear in most rocks apart from basalts and are extremely durable, surviving every natural \nprocess but subduction. Most of the Earth\u2019s crust has been slipped back into the oven at some \npoint, but just occasionally\u2014in Western Australia and Greenland, for example\u2014geologists \nhave found outcrops of rocks that have remained always at the surface. Compston\u2019s machine \nallowed such rocks to be dated with unparalleled precision. The prototype SHRIMP was builtand machined in the Earth Science department\u2019s own workshops, and looked like something \nthat had been built from spare parts on a budget, but it worked great. On its first formal test, in \n1982, it dated the oldest thing ever found\u2014a 4.3-billion-year-old rock from Western \nAustralia. \n    \u201cIt caused quite a stir at the time,\u201d Bennett told me, \u201cto find something so important so \nquickly with brand-new technology.\u201d \n    She took me down the hall to see the current model, SHRIMP II. It was a big heavy piece \nof stainless-steel apparatus, perhaps twelve feet long and five feet high, and as solidly built as \na deep-sea probe. At a console in front of it, keeping an eye on ever-changing strings of \nfigures on a screen, was a man named Bob from Canterbury University in New Zealand. He \nhad been there since 4 A.M., he told me. SHRIMP II runs twenty-four hours a day; there\u2019s that \nmany rocks to date. It was just after 9A.M. and Bob had the machine till noon. Ask a pair of \ngeochemists how something like this works, and they will start talking about isotopic \nabundances and ionization levels with an enthusiasm that is more endearing than fathomable. \nThe upshot of it, however, was that the machine, by bombarding a sample of rock with \nstreams of charged atoms, is able to detect subtle differences in the amounts of lead and \nuranium in the zircon samples, by which means the age of rocks can be accurately adduced. \nBob told me that it takes about seventeen minutes to read one zircon and it is necessary to \nread dozens from each rock to make the data reliable. In practice, the process seemed to \ninvolve about the same level of scattered activity, and about as much stimulation, as a trip to a \nlaundromat. Bob seemed very happy, however; but then people from New Zealand very \ngenerally do. \n    The Earth Sciences compound was an odd combination of things\u2014part offices, part labs, \npart machine shed. \u201cWe used to build everything here,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe even had our own \nglassblower, but he\u2019s retired. But we still have two full-time rock crushers.\u201d She caught my \nlook of mild surprise. \u201cWe get through a lot of rocks. And they have to be very carefully \nprepared. You have to make sure there is no contamination from previous samples\u2014no dust \nor anything. It\u2019s quite a meticulous process.\u201d She showed me the rock-crushing machines, \nwhich were indeed pristine, though the rock crushers had apparently gone for coffee. Beside \nthe machines were large boxes containing rocks of all shapes and sizes. They do indeed get \nthrough a lot of rocks at the ANU. \n    Back in Bennett\u2019s office after our tour, I noticed hanging on her wall a poster giving an \nartist\u2019s colorfully imaginative interpretation of Earth as it might have looked 3.5 billion years \nago, just when life was getting going, in the ancient period known to earth science as the \nArchaean. The poster showed an alien landscape of huge, very active volcanoes, and a \nsteamy, copper-colored sea beneath a harsh red sky. Stromatolites, a kind of bacterial rock, \nfilled the shallows in the foreground. It didn\u2019t look like a very promising place to create and \nnurture life. I asked her if the painting was accurate. \n    \u201cWell, one school of thought says it was actually cool then because the sun was much \nweaker.\u201d (I later learned that biologists, when they are feeling jocose, refer to this as the \n\u201cChinese restaurant problem\u201d\u2014because we had a dim sun.) \u201cWithout an atmosphere \nultraviolet rays from the sun, even from a weak sun, would have tended to break apart any \nincipient bonds made by molecules. And yet right there\u201d\u2014she tapped the stromatolites\u2014\u201cyou \nhave organisms almost at the surface. It\u2019s a puzzle.\u201d \n    \u201cSo we don\u2019t know what the world was like back then?\u201d\u201cMmmm,\u201d she agreed thoughtfully. \n    \u201cEither way it doesn\u2019t seem very conducive to life.\u201d \n    She nodded amiably. \u201cBut there must have been something that suited life. Otherwise we \nwouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d \n  \n    It certainly wouldn\u2019t have suited us. If you were to step from a time machine into that \nancient Archaean world, you would very swiftly scamper back inside, for there was no more \noxygen to breathe on Earth back then than there is on Mars today. It was also full of noxious \nvapors from hydrochloric and sulfuric acids powerful enough to eat through clothing and \nblister skin. Nor would it have provided the clean and glowing vistas depicted in the poster in \nVictoria Bennett\u2019s office. The chemical stew that was the atmosphere then would have \nallowed little sunlight to reach the Earth\u2019s surface. What little you could see would be \nillumined only briefly by bright and frequent lightning flashes. In short, it was Earth, but an \nEarth we wouldn\u2019t recognize as our own. \n    Anniversaries were few and far between in the Archaean world. For two billion years \nbacterial organisms were the only forms of life. They lived, they reproduced, they swarmed, \nbut they didn\u2019t show any particular inclination to move on to another, more challenging level \nof existence. At some point in the first billion years of life, cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, \nlearned to tap into a freely available resource\u2014the hydrogen that exists in spectacular \nabundance in water. They absorbed water molecules, supped on the hydrogen, and released \nthe oxygen as waste, and in so doing invented photosynthesis. As Margulis and Sagan note, \nphotosynthesis is \u201cundoubtedly the most important single metabolic innovation in the history \nof life on the planet\u201d\u2014and it was invented not by plants but by bacteria. \n    As cyanobacteria proliferated the world began to fill with O2to the consternation of those \norganisms that found it poisonous\u2014which in those days was all of them. In an anaerobic (or a \nnon-oxygen-using) world, oxygen is extremely poisonous. Our white cells actually use \noxygen to kill invading bacteria. That oxygen is fundamentally toxic often comes as a surprise \nto those of us who find it so convivial to our well-being, but that is only because we have \nevolved to exploit it. To other things it is a terror. It is what turns butter rancid and makes iron \nrust. Even we can tolerate it only up to a point. The oxygen level in our cells is only about a \ntenth the level found in the atmosphere. \n    The new oxygen-using organisms had two advantages. Oxygen was a more efficient way to \nproduce energy, and it vanquished competitor organisms. Some retreated into the oozy, \nanaerobic world of bogs and lake bottoms. Others did likewise but then later (much later) \nmigrated to the digestive tracts of beings like you and me. Quite a number of these primeval \nentities are alive inside your body right now, helping to digest your food, but abhorring even \nthe tiniest hint of O2. Untold numbers of others failed to adapt and died. \n    The cyanobacteria were a runaway success. At first, the extra oxygen they produced didn\u2019t \naccumulate in the atmosphere, but combined with iron to form ferric oxides, which sank to the \nbottom of primitive seas. For millions of years, the world literally rusted\u2014a phenomenon \nvividly recorded in the banded iron deposits that provide so much of the world\u2019s iron ore \ntoday. For many tens of millions of years not a great deal more than this happened. If you \nwent back to that early Proterozoic world you wouldn\u2019t find many signs of promise forEarth\u2019s future life. Perhaps here and there in sheltered pools you\u2019d encounter a film of living \nscum or a coating of glossy greens and browns on shoreline rocks, but otherwise life remained \ninvisible. \n    But about 3.5 billion years ago something more emphatic became apparent. Wherever the \nseas were shallow, visible structures began to appear. As they went through their chemical \nroutines, the cyanobacteria became very slightly tacky, and that tackiness trapped \nmicroparticles of dust and sand, which became bound together to form slightly weird but solid \nstructures\u2014the stromatolites that were featured in the shallows of the poster on Victoria \nBennett\u2019s office wall. Stromatolites came in various shapes and sizes. Sometimes they looked \nlike enormous cauliflowers, sometimes like fluffy mattresses (stromatolite comes from the \nGreek for \u201cmattress\u201d), sometimes they came in the form of columns, rising tens of meters \nabove the surface of the water\u2014sometimes as high as a hundred meters. In all their \nmanifestations, they were a kind of living rock, and they represented the world\u2019s first \ncooperative venture, with some varieties of primitive organism living just at the surface and \nothers living just underneath, each taking advantage of conditions created by the other. The \nworld had its first ecosystem. \n    For many years, scientists knew about stromatolites from fossil formations, but in 1961 \nthey got a real surprise with the discovery of a community of living stromatolites at Shark \nBay on the remote northwest coast of Australia. This was most unexpected\u2014so unexpected, \nin fact, that it was some years before scientists realized quite what they had found. Today, \nhowever, Shark Bay is a tourist attraction\u2014or at least as much of a tourist attraction as a place \nhundreds of miles from anywhere much and dozens of miles from anywhere at all can ever be. \nBoardwalks have been built out into the bay so that visitors can stroll over the water to get a \ngood look at the stromatolites, quietly respiring just beneath the surface. They are lusterless \nand gray and look, as I recorded in an earlier book, like very large cow-pats. But it is a \ncuriously giddying moment to find yourself staring at living remnants of Earth as it was 3.5 \nbillion years ago. As Richard Fortey has put it: \u201cThis is truly time traveling, and if the world \nwere attuned to its real wonders this sight would be as well-known as the pyramids of Giza.\u201d \nAlthough you\u2019d never guess it, these dull rocks swarm with life, with an estimated (well, \nobviously estimated) three billion individual organisms on every square yard of rock. \nSometimes when you look carefully you can see tiny strings of bubbles rising to the surface as \nthey give up their oxygen. In two billion years such tiny exertions raised the level of oxygen \nin Earth\u2019s atmosphere to 20 percent, preparing the way for the next, more complex chapter in \nlife\u2019s history. \n    It has been suggested that the cyanobacteria at Shark Bay are perhaps the slowest-evolving \norganisms on Earth, and certainly now they are among the rarest. Having prepared the way for \nmore complex life forms, they were then grazed out of existence nearly everywhere by the \nvery organisms whose existence they had made possible. (They exist at Shark Bay because \nthe waters are too saline for the creatures that would normally feast on them.) \n    One reason life took so long to grow complex was that the world had to wait until the \nsimpler organisms had oxygenated the atmosphere sufficiently. \u201cAnimals could not summon \nup the energy to work,\u201d as Fortey has put it. It took about two billion years, roughly 40 \npercent of Earth\u2019s history, for oxygen levels to reach more or less modern levels of \nconcentration in the atmosphere. But once the stage was set, and apparently quite suddenly, an \nentirely new type of cell arose\u2014one with a nucleus and other little bodies collectively called \norganelles (from a Greek word meaning \u201clittle tools\u201d). The process is thought to have started \nwhen some blundering or adventuresome bacterium either invaded or was captured by someother bacterium and it turned out that this suited them both. The captive bacterium became, it \nis thought, a mitochondrion. This mitochondrial invasion (or endosymbiotic event, as \nbiologists like to term it) made complex life possible. (In plants a similar invasion produced \nchloroplasts, which enable plants to photosynthesize.) \n    Mitochondria manipulate oxygen in a way that liberates energy from foodstuffs. Without \nthis niftily facilitating trick, life on Earth today would be nothing more than a sludge of \nsimple microbes. Mitochondria are very tiny\u2014you could pack a billion into the space \noccupied by a grain of sand\u2014but also very hungry. Almost every nutriment you absorb goes \nto feeding them. \n    We couldn\u2019t live for two minutes without them, yet even after a billion years mitochondria \nbehave as if they think things might not work out between us. They maintain their own DNA. \nThey reproduce at a different time from their host cell. They look like bacteria, divide like \nbacteria, and sometimes respond to antibiotics in the way bacteria do. In short, they keep their \nbags packed. They don\u2019t even speak the same genetic language as the cell in which they live. \nIt is like having a stranger in your house, but one who has been there for a billion years. \n    The new type of cell is known as a eukaryote (meaning \u201ctruly nucleated\u201d), as contrasted \nwith the old type, which is known as a prokaryote (\u201cprenucleated\u201d), and it seems to have \narrived suddenly in the fossil record. The oldest eukaryotes yet known, called Grypania, were \ndiscovered in iron sediments in Michigan in 1992. Such fossils have been found just once, and \nthen no more are known for 500 million years. \n    Compared with the new eukaryotes the old prokaryotes were little more than \u201cbags of \nchemicals,\u201d in the words of the geologist Stephen Drury. Eukaryotes were bigger\u2014eventually \nas much as ten thousand times bigger\u2014than their simpler cousins, and carried as much as a \nthousand times more DNA. Gradually a system evolved in which life was dominated by two \ntypes of form\u2014organisms that expel oxygen (like plants) and those that take it in (you and \nme). \n    Single-celled eukaryotes were once called protozoa (\u201cpre-animals\u201d), but that term is \nincreasingly disdained. Today the common term for them is protists . Compared with the \nbacteria that had gone before, these new protists were wonders of design and sophistication. \nThe simple amoeba, just one cell big and without any ambitions but to exist, contains 400 \nmillion bits of genetic information in its DNA\u2014enough, as Carl Sagan noted, to fill eighty \nbooks of five hundred pages. \n    Eventually the eukaryotes learned an even more singular trick. It took a long time\u2014a \nbillion years or so\u2014but it was a good one when they mastered it. They learned to form \ntogether into complex multicellular beings. Thanks to this innovation, big, complicated, \nvisible entities like us were possible. Planet Earth was ready to move on to its next ambitious \nphase. \n    But before we get too excited about that, it is worth remembering that the world, as we are \nabout to see, still belongs to the very small.", "20": "20    SMALL WORLD \n \n \n \n \nIT\u2019S PROBABLY NOT a good idea to take too personal an interest in your microbes. Louis \nPasteur, the great French chemist and bacteriologist, became so preoccupied with them that he \ntook to peering critically at every dish placed before him with a magnifying glass, a habit that \npresumably did not win him many repeat invitations to dinner. \n    In fact, there is no point in trying to hide from your bacteria, for they are on and around you \nalways, in numbers you can\u2019t conceive. If you are in good health and averagely diligent about \nhygiene, you will have a herd of about one trillion bacteria grazing on your fleshy plains\u2014\nabout a hundred thousand of them on every square centimeter of skin. They are there to dine \noff the ten billion or so flakes of skin you shed every day, plus all the tasty oils and fortifying \nminerals that seep out from every pore and fissure. You are for them the ultimate food court, \nwith the convenience of warmth and constant mobility thrown in. By way of thanks, they give \nyou B.O. \n    And those are just the bacteria that inhabit your skin. There are trillions more tucked away \nin your gut and nasal passages, clinging to your hair and eyelashes, swimming over the \nsurface of your eyes, drilling through the enamel of your teeth. Your digestive system alone is \nhost to more than a hundred trillion microbes, of at least four hundred types. Some deal with \nsugars, some with starches, some attack other bacteria. A surprising number, like the \nubiquitous intestinal spirochetes, have no detectable function at all. They just seem to like to \nbe with you. Every human body consists of about 10 quadrillion cells, but about 100 \nquadrillion bacterial cells. They are, in short, a big part of us. From the bacteria\u2019s point of \nview, of course, we are a rather small part of them. \n    Because we humans are big and clever enough to produce and utilize antibiotics and \ndisinfectants, it is easy to convince ourselves that we have banished bacteria to the fringes of \nexistence. Don\u2019t you believe it. Bacteria may not build cities or have interesting social lives, \nbut they will be here when the Sun explodes. This is their planet, and we are on it only \nbecause they allow us to be. \n    Bacteria, never forget, got along for billions of years without us. We couldn\u2019t survive a day \nwithout them. They process our wastes and make them usable again; without their diligent \nmunching nothing would rot. They purify our water and keep our soils productive. Bacteria \nsynthesize vitamins in our gut, convert the things we eat into useful sugars and \npolysaccharides, and go to war on alien microbes that slip down our gullet. \n    We depend totally on bacteria to pluck nitrogen from the air and convert it into useful \nnucleotides and amino acids for us. It is a prodigious and gratifying feat. As Margulis and \nSagan note, to do the same thing industrially (as when making fertilizers) manufacturers must \nheat the source materials to 500 degrees centigrade and squeeze them to three hundred times \nnormal pressures. Bacteria do it all the time without fuss, and thank goodness, for no largerorganism could survive without the nitrogen they pass on. Above all, microbes continue to \nprovide us with the air we breathe and to keep the atmosphere stable. Microbes, including the \nmodern versions of cyanobacteria, supply the greater part of the planet\u2019s breathable oxygen. \nAlgae and other tiny organisms bubbling away in the sea blow out about 150 billion kilos of \nthe stuff every year. \n    And they are amazingly prolific. The more frantic among them can yield a new generation \nin less than ten minutes; Clostridium perfringens, the disagreeable little organism that causes \ngangrene, can reproduce in nine minutes. At such a rate, a single bacterium could theoretically \nproduce more offspring in two days than there are protons in the universe. \u201cGiven an adequate \nsupply of nutrients, a single bacterial cell can generate 280,000 billion individuals in a single \nday,\u201d according to the Belgian biochemist and Nobel laureate Christian de Duve. In the same \nperiod, a human cell can just about manage a single division. \n    About once every million divisions, they produce a mutant. Usually this is bad luck for the \nmutant\u2014change is always risky for an organism\u2014but just occasionally the new bacterium is \nendowed with some accidental advantage, such as the ability to elude or shrug off an attack of \nantibiotics. With this ability to evolve rapidly goes another, even scarier advantage. Bacteria \nshare information. Any bacterium can take pieces of genetic coding from any other. \nEssentially, as Margulis and Sagan put it, all bacteria swim in a single gene pool. Any \nadaptive change that occurs in one area of the bacterial universe can spread to any other. It\u2019s \nrather as if a human could go to an insect to get the necessary genetic coding to sprout wings \nor walk on ceilings. It means that from a genetic point of view bacteria have become a single \nsuperorganism\u2014tiny, dispersed, but invincible. \n    They will live and thrive on almost anything you spill, dribble, or shake loose. Just give \nthem a little moisture\u2014as when you run a damp cloth over a counter\u2014and they will bloom as \nif created from nothing. They will eat wood, the glue in wallpaper, the metals in hardened \npaint. Scientists in Australia found microbes known as Thiobacillus concretivorans that lived \nin\u2014indeed, could not live without\u2014concentrations of sulfuric acid strong enough to dissolve \nmetal. A species called Micrococcus radiophilus was found living happily in the waste tanks \nof nuclear reactors, gorging itself on plutonium and whatever else was there. Some bacteria \nbreak down chemical materials from which, as far as we can tell, they gain no benefit at all. \n    They have been found living in boiling mud pots and lakes of caustic soda, deep inside \nrocks, at the bottom of the sea, in hidden pools of icy water in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of \nAntarctica, and seven miles down in the Pacific Ocean where pressures are more than a \nthousand times greater than at the surface, or equivalent to being squashed beneath fifty \njumbo jets. Some of them seem to be practically indestructible. Deinococcus radiodurans is, \naccording to theEconomist , \u201calmost immune to radioactivity.\u201d Blast its DNA with radiation, \nand the pieces immediately reform \u201clike the scuttling limbs of an undead creature from a \nhorror movie.\u201d \n    Perhaps the most extraordinary survival yet found was that of a Streptococcus bacterium \nthat was recovered from the sealed lens of a camera that had stood on the Moon for two years. \nIn short, there are few environments in which bacteria aren\u2019t prepared to live. \u201cThey are \nfinding now that when they push probes into ocean vents so hot that the probes actually start \nto melt, there are bacteria even there,\u201d Victoria Bennett told me. \n    In the 1920s two scientists at the University of Chicago, Edson Bastin and Frank Greer, \nannounced that they had isolated from oil wells strains of bacteria that had been living atdepths of two thousand feet. The notion was dismissed as fundamentally preposterous\u2014there \nwas nothing to live on at two thousand feet\u2014and for fifty years it was assumed that their \nsamples had been contaminated with surface microbes. We now know that there are a lot of \nmicrobes living deep within the Earth, many of which have nothing at all to do with the \norganic world. They eat rocks or, rather, the stuff that\u2019s in rocks\u2014iron, sulfur, manganese, \nand so on. And they breathe odd things too\u2014iron, chromium, cobalt, even uranium. Such \nprocesses may be instrumental in concentrating gold, copper, and other precious metals, and \npossibly deposits of oil and natural gas. It has even been suggested that their tireless nibblings \ncreated the Earth\u2019s crust. \n    Some scientists now think that there could be as much as 100 trillion tons of bacteria living \nbeneath our feet in what are known as subsurface lithoautotrophic microbial ecosystems\u2014\nSLiME for short. Thomas Gold of Cornell has estimated that if you took all the bacteria out of \nthe Earth\u2019s interior and dumped it on the surface, it would cover the planet to a depth of five \nfeet. If the estimates are correct, there could be more life under the Earth than on top of it. \n    At depth microbes shrink in size and become extremely sluggish. The liveliest of them may \ndivide no more than once a century, some no more than perhaps once in five hundred years. \nAs the Economist has put it: \u201cThe key to long life, it seems, is not to do too much.\u201d When \nthings are really tough, bacteria are prepared to shut down all systems and wait for better \ntimes. In 1997 scientists successfully activated some anthrax spores that had lain dormant for \neighty years in a museum display in Trondheim, Norway. Other microorganisms have leapt \nback to life after being released from a 118-year-old can of meat and a 166-year-old bottle of \nbeer. In 1996, scientists at the Russian Academy of Science claimed to have revived bacteria \nfrozen in Siberian permafrost for three million years. But the record claim for durability so far \nis one made by Russell Vreeland and colleagues at West Chester University in Pennsylvania \nin 2000, when they announced that they had resuscitated 250-million-year-old bacteria called \nBacillus permians that had been trapped in salt deposits two thousand feet underground in \nCarlsbad, New Mexico. If so, this microbe is older than the continents. \n    The report met with some understandable dubiousness. Many biochemists maintained that \nover such a span the microbe\u2019s components would have become uselessly degraded unless the \nbacterium roused itself from time to time. However, if the bacterium did stir occasionally \nthere was no plausible internal source of energy that could have lasted so long. The more \ndoubtful scientists suggested that the sample may have been contaminated, if not during its \nretrieval then perhaps while still buried. In 2001, a team from Tel Aviv University argued that \nB. permians were almost identical to a strain of modern bacteria, Bacillus marismortui, found \nin the Dead Sea. Only two of its genetic sequences differed, and then only slightly. \n    \u201cAre we to believe,\u201d the Israeli researchers wrote, \u201cthat in 250 million years B. permians \nhas accumulated the same amount of genetic differences that could be achieved in just 3\u20137 \ndays in the laboratory?\u201d In reply, Vreeland suggested that \u201cbacteria evolve faster in the lab \nthan they do in the wild.\u201d \n    Maybe. \n  \n    It is a remarkable fact that well into the space age, most school textbooks divided the world \nof the living into just two categories\u2014plant and animal. Microorganisms hardly featured. \nAmoebas and similar single-celled organisms were treated as proto-animals and algae asproto-plants. Bacteria were usually lumped in with plants, too, even though everyone knew \nthey didn\u2019t belong there. As far back as the late nineteenth century the German naturalist \nErnst Haeckel had suggested that bacteria deserved to be placed in a separate kingdom, which \nhe called Monera, but the idea didn\u2019t begin to catch on among biologists until the 1960s and \nthen only among some of them. (I note that my trusty American Heritage desk dictionary \nfrom 1969 doesn\u2019t recognize the term.) \n    Many organisms in the visible world were also poorly served by the traditional division. \nFungi, the group that includes mushrooms, molds, mildews, yeasts, and puffballs, were nearly \nalways treated as botanical objects, though in fact almost nothing about them\u2014how they \nreproduce and respire, how they build themselves\u2014matches anything in the plant world. \nStructurally they have more in common with animals in that they build their cells from chitin, \na material that gives them their distinctive texture. The same substance is used to make the \nshells of insects and the claws of mammals, though it isn\u2019t nearly so tasty in a stag beetle as in \na Portobello mushroom. Above all, unlike all plants, fungi don\u2019t photosynthesize, so they \nhave no chlorophyll and thus are not green. Instead they grow directly on their food source, \nwhich can be almost anything. Fungi will eat the sulfur off a concrete wall or the decaying \nmatter between your toes\u2014two things no plant will do. Almost the only plantlike quality they \nhave is that they root. \n    Even less comfortably susceptible to categorization was the peculiar group of organisms \nformally called myxomycetes but more commonly known as slime molds. The name no doubt \nhas much to do with their obscurity. An appellation that sounded a little more dynamic\u2014\n\u201cambulant self-activating protoplasm,\u201d say\u2014and less like the stuff you find when you reach \ndeep into a clogged drain would almost certainly have earned these extraordinary entities a \nmore immediate share of the attention they deserve, for slime molds are, make no mistake, \namong the most interesting organisms in nature. When times are good, they exist as one-\ncelled individuals, much like amoebas. But when conditions grow tough, they crawl to a \ncentral gathering place and become, almost miraculously, a slug. The slug is not a thing of \nbeauty and it doesn\u2019t go terribly far\u2014usually just from the bottom of a pile of leaf litter to the \ntop, where it is in a slightly more exposed position\u2014but for millions of years this may well \nhave been the niftiest trick in the universe. \n    And it doesn\u2019t stop there. Having hauled itself up to a more favorable locale, the slime \nmold transforms itself yet again, taking on the form of a plant. By some curious orderly \nprocess the cells reconfigure, like the members of a tiny marching band, to make a stalk atop \nof which forms a bulb known as a fruiting body. Inside the fruiting body are millions of \nspores that, at the appropriate moment, are released to the wind to blow away and become \nsingle-celled organisms that can start the process again. \n    For years slime molds were claimed as protozoa by zoologists and as fungi by mycologists, \nthough most people could see they didn\u2019t really belong anywhere. When genetic testing \narrived, people in lab coats were surprised to find that slime molds were so distinctive and \npeculiar that they weren\u2019t directly related to anything else in nature, and sometimes not even \nto each other. \n    In 1969, in an attempt to bring some order to the growing inadequacies of classification, an \necologist from Cornell University named R. H. Whittaker unveiled in the journalScience a \nproposal to divide life into five principal branches\u2014kingdoms, as they are known\u2014called \nAnimalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, and Monera. Protista, was a modification of an earlierterm, Protoctista, which had been suggested a century earlier by a Scottish biologist named \nJohn Hogg, and was meant to describe any organisms that were neither plant nor animal. \n    Though Whittaker\u2019s new scheme was a great improvement, Protista remained ill defined. \nSome taxonomists reserved it for large unicellular organisms\u2014the eukaryotes\u2014but others \ntreated it as the kind of odd sock drawer of biology, putting into it anything that didn\u2019t fit \nanywhere else. It included (depending on which text you consulted) slime molds, amoebas, \nand even seaweed, among much else. By one calculation it contained as many as 200,000 \ndifferent species of organism all told. That\u2019s a lot of odd socks. \n    Ironically, just as Whittaker\u2019s five-kingdom classification was beginning to find its way \ninto textbooks, a retiring academic at the University of Illinois was groping his way toward a \ndiscovery that would challenge everything. His name was Carl Woese (rhymes with rose), and \nsince the mid-1960s\u2014or about as early as it was possible to do so\u2014he had been quietly \nstudying genetic sequences in bacteria. In the early days, this was an exceedingly painstaking \nprocess. Work on a single bacterium could easily consume a year. At that time, according to \nWoese, only about 500 species of bacteria were known, which is fewer than the number of \nspecies you have in your mouth. Today the number is about ten times that, though that is still \nfar short of the 26,900 species of algae, 70,000 of fungi, and 30,800 of amoebas and related \norganisms whose biographies fill the annals of biology. \n    It isn\u2019t simple indifference that keeps the total low. Bacteria can be exasperatingly difficult \nto isolate and study. Only about 1 percent will grow in culture. Considering how wildly \nadaptable they are in nature, it is an odd fact that the one place they seem not to wish to live is \na petri dish. Plop them on a bed of agar and pamper them as you will, and most will just lie \nthere, declining every inducement to bloom. Any bacterium that thrives in a lab is by \ndefinition exceptional, and yet these were, almost exclusively, the organisms studied by \nmicrobiologists. It was, said Woese, \u201clike learning about animals from visiting zoos.\u201d \n    Genes, however, allowed Woese to approach microorganisms from another angle. As he \nworked, Woese realized that there were more fundamental divisions in the microbial world \nthan anyone suspected. A lot of little organisms that looked like bacteria and behaved like \nbacteria were actually something else altogether\u2014something that had branched off from \nbacteria a long time ago. Woese called these organisms archaebacteria, later shortened to \narchaea. \n    It has be said that the attributes that distinguish archaea from bacteria are not the sort that \nwould quicken the pulse of any but a biologist. They are mostly differences in their lipids and \nan absence of something called peptidoglycan. But in practice they make a world of \ndifference. Archaeans are more different from bacteria than you and I are from a crab or \nspider. Singlehandedly Woese had discovered an unsuspected division of life, so fundamental \nthat it stood above the level of kingdom at the apogee of the Universal Tree of Life, as it is \nrather reverentially known. \n    In 1976, he startled the world\u2014or at least the little bit of it that was paying attention\u2014by \nredrawing the tree of life to incorporate not five main divisions, but twenty-three. These he \ngrouped under three new principal categories\u2014Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (sometimes \nspelled Eucarya)\u2014which he called domains. \n    Woese\u2019s new divisions did not take the biological world by storm. Some dismissed them as \nmuch too heavily weighted toward the microbial. Many just ignored them. Woese, accordingto Frances Ashcroft, \u201cfelt bitterly disappointed.\u201d But slowly his new scheme began to catch \non among microbiologists. Botanists and zoologists were much slower to admire its virtues. \nIt\u2019s not hard to see why. On Woese\u2019s model, the worlds of botany and zoology are relegated \nto a few twigs on the outermost branch of the Eukaryan limb. Everything else belongs to \nunicellular beings. \n    \u201cThese folks were brought up to classify in terms of gross morphological similarities and \ndifferences,\u201d Woese told an interviewer in 1996. \u201cThe idea of doing so in terms of molecular \nsequence is a bit hard for many of them to swallow.\u201d In short, if they couldn\u2019t see a difference \nwith their own eyes, they didn\u2019t like it. And so they persisted with the traditional five-\nkingdom division\u2014an arrangement that Woese called \u201cnot very useful\u201d in his milder \nmoments and \u201cpositively misleading\u201d much of the rest of the time. \u201cBiology, like physics \nbefore it,\u201d Woese wrote, \u201chas moved to a level where the objects of interest and their \ninteractions often cannot be perceived through direct observation.\u201d \n    In 1998 the great and ancient Harvard zoologist Ernst Mayr (who then was in his ninety-\nfourth year and at the time of my writing is nearing one hundred and still going strong) stirred \nthe pot further by declaring that there should be just two prime divisions of life\u2014\u201cempires\u201d \nhe called them. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, \nMayr said that Woese\u2019s findings were interesting but ultimately misguided, noting that \n\u201cWoese was not trained as a biologist and quite naturally does not have an extensive \nfamiliarity with the principles of classification,\u201d which is perhaps as close as one \ndistinguished scientist can come to saying of another that he doesn\u2019t know what he is talking \nabout. \n    The specifics of Mayr\u2019s criticisms are too technical to need extensive airing here\u2014they \ninvolve issues of meiotic sexuality, Hennigian cladification, and controversial interpretations \nof the genome of Methanobacterium thermoautrophicum, among rather a lot else\u2014but \nessentially he argues that Woese\u2019s arrangement unbalances the tree of life. The bacterial \nrealm, Mayr notes, consists of no more than a few thousand species while the archaean has a \nmere 175 named specimens, with perhaps a few thousand more to be found\u2014\u201cbut hardly \nmore than that.\u201d By contrast, the eukaryotic realm\u2014that is, the complicated organisms with \nnucleated cells, like us\u2014numbers already in the millions. For the sake of \u201cthe principle of \nbalance,\u201d Mayr argues for combining the simple bacterial organisms in a single category, \nProkaryota, while placing the more complex and \u201chighly evolved\u201d remainder in the empire \nEukaryota, which would stand alongside as an equal. Put another way, he argues for keeping \nthings much as they were before. This division between simple cells and complex cells \u201cis \nwhere the great break is in the living world.\u201d \n    The distinction between halophilic archaeans and methanosarcina or between flavobacteria \nand gram-positive bacteria clearly will never be a matter of moment for most of us, but it is \nworth remembering that each is as different from its neighbors as animals are from plants. If \nWoese\u2019s new arrangement teaches us anything it is that life really is various and that most of \nthat variety is small, unicellular, and unfamiliar. It is a natural human impulse to think of \nevolution as a long chain of improvements, of a never-ending advance toward largeness and \ncomplexity\u2014in a word, toward us. We flatter ourselves. Most of the real diversity in \nevolution has been small-scale. We large things are just flukes\u2014an interesting side branch. Of \nthe twenty-three main divisions of life, only three\u2014plants, animals, and fungi\u2014are large \nenough to be seen by the human eye, and even they contain species that are microscopic. \nIndeed, according to Woese, if you totaled up all the biomass of the planet\u2014every livingthing, plants included\u2014microbes would account for at least 80 percent of all there is, perhaps \nmore. The world belongs to the very small\u2014and it has for a very long time. \n  \n    So why, you are bound to ask at some point in your life, do microbes so often want to hurt \nus? What possible satisfaction could there be to a microbe in having us grow feverish or \nchilled, or disfigured with sores, or above all expire? A dead host, after all, is hardly going to \nprovide long-term hospitality. \n    To begin with, it is worth remembering that most microorganisms are neutral or even \nbeneficial to human well-being. The most rampantly infectious organism on Earth, a \nbacterium called Wolbachia, doesn\u2019t hurt humans at all\u2014or, come to that, any other \nvertebrates\u2014but if you are a shrimp or worm or fruit fly, it can make you wish you had never \nbeen born. Altogether, only about one microbe in a thousand is a pathogen for humans, \naccording to National Geographic \u2014though, knowing what some of them can do, we could \nbe forgiven for thinking that that is quite enough. Even if mostly benign, microbes are still the \nnumber-three killer in the Western world, and even many less lethal ones of course make us \ndeeply rue their existence. \n    Making a host unwell has certain benefits for the microbe. The symptoms of an illness \noften help to spread the disease. Vomiting, sneezing, and diarrhea are excellent methods of \ngetting out of one host and into position for another. The most effective strategy of all is to \nenlist the help of a mobile third party. Infectious organisms love mosquitoes because the \nmosquito\u2019s sting delivers them directly to a bloodstream where they can get straight to work \nbefore the victim\u2019s defense mechanisms can figure out what\u2019s hit them. This is why so many \ngrade-A diseases\u2014malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, encephalitis, and a hundred or so \nother less celebrated but often rapacious maladies\u2014begin with a mosquito bite. It is a \nfortunate fluke for us that HIV, the AIDS agent, isn\u2019t among them\u2014at least not yet. Any HIV \nthe mosquito sucks up on its travels is dissolved by the mosquito\u2019s own metabolism. When \nthe day comes that the virus mutates its way around this, we may be in real trouble. \n    It is a mistake, however, to consider the matter too carefully from the position of logic \nbecause microorganisms clearly are not calculating entities. They don\u2019t care what they do to \nyou any more than you care what distress you cause when you slaughter them by the millions \nwith a soapy shower or a swipe of deodorant. The only time your continuing well-being is of \nconsequence to a pathogen is when it kills you too well. If they eliminate you before they can \nmove on, then they may well die out themselves. This in fact sometimes happens. History, \nJared Diamond notes, is full of diseases that \u201conce caused terrifying epidemics and then \ndisappeared as mysteriously as they had come.\u201d He cites the robust but mercifully transient \nEnglish sweating sickness, which raged from 1485 to 1552, killing tens of thousands as it \nwent, before burning itself out. Too much efficiency is not a good thing for any infectious \norganism. \n    A great deal of sickness arises not because of what the organism has done to you but what \nyour body is trying to do to the organism. In its quest to rid the body of pathogens, the \nimmune system sometimes destroys cells or damages critical tissues, so often when you are \nunwell what you are feeling is not the pathogens but your own immune responses. Anyway, \ngetting sick is a sensible response to infection. Sick people retire to their beds and thus are \nless of a threat to the wider community. Resting also frees more of the body\u2019s resources to \nattend to the infection.Because there are so many things out there with the potential to hurt you, your body holds \nlots of different varieties of defensive white cells\u2014some ten million types in all, each \ndesigned to identify and destroy a particular sort of invader. It would be impossibly inefficient \nto maintain ten million separate standing armies, so each variety of white cell keeps only a \nfew scouts on active duty. When an infectious agent\u2014what\u2019s known as an antigen\u2014invades, \nrelevant scouts identify the attacker and put out a call for reinforcements of the right type. \nWhile your body is manufacturing these forces, you are likely to feel wretched. The onset of \nrecovery begins when the troops finally swing into action. \n    White cells are merciless and will hunt down and kill every last pathogen they can find. To \navoid extinction, attackers have evolved two elemental strategies. Either they strike quickly \nand move on to a new host, as with common infectious illnesses like flu, or they disguise \nthemselves so that the white cells fail to spot them, as with HIV, the virus responsible for \nAIDS, which can sit harmlessly and unnoticed in the nuclei of cells for years before springing \ninto action. \n    One of the odder aspects of infection is that microbes that normally do no harm at all \nsometimes get into the wrong parts of the body and \u201cgo kind of crazy,\u201d in the words of Dr. \nBryan Marsh, an infectious diseases specialist at Dartmouth\u2013Hitchcock Medical Center in \nLebanon, New Hamphire. \u201cIt happens all the time with car accidents when people suffer \ninternal injuries. Microbes that are normally benign in the gut get into other parts of the \nbody\u2014the bloodstream, for instance\u2014and cause terrible havoc.\u201d \n    The scariest, most out-of-control bacterial disorder of the moment is a disease called \nnecrotizing fasciitis in which bacteria essentially eat the victim from the inside out, devouring \ninternal tissue and leaving behind a pulpy, noxious residue. Patients often come in with \ncomparatively mild complaints\u2014a skin rash and fever typically\u2014but then dramatically \ndeteriorate. When they are opened up it is often found that they are simply being consumed. \nThe only treatment is what is known as \u201cradical excisional surgery\u201d\u2014cutting out every bit of \ninfected area. Seventy percent of victims die; many of the rest are left terribly disfigured. The \nsource of the infection is a mundane family of bacteria called Group A Streptococcus, which \nnormally do no more than cause strep throat. Very occasionally, for reasons unknown, some \nof these bacteria get through the lining of the throat and into the body proper, where they \nwreak the most devastating havoc. They are completely resistant to antibiotics. About a \nthousand cases a year occur in the United States, and no one can say that it won\u2019t get worse. \n    Precisely the same thing happens with meningitis. At least 10 percent of young adults, and \nperhaps 30 percent of teenagers, carry the deadly meningococcal bacterium, but it lives quite \nharmlessly in the throat. Just occasionally\u2014in about one young person in a hundred \nthousand\u2014it gets into the bloodstream and makes them very ill indeed. In the worst cases, \ndeath can come in twelve hours. That\u2019s shockingly quick. \u201cYou can have a person who\u2019s in \nperfect health at breakfast and dead by evening,\u201d says Marsh. \n    We would have much more success with bacteria if we weren\u2019t so profligate with our best \nweapon against them: antibiotics. Remarkably, by one estimate some 70 percent of the \nantibiotics used in the developed world are given to farm animals, often routinely in stock \nfeed, simply to promote growth or as a precaution against infection. Such applications give \nbacteria every opportunity to evolve a resistance to them. It is an opportunity that they have \nenthusiastically seized.In 1952, penicillin was fully effective against all strains of staphylococcus bacteria, to such \nan extent that by the early 1960s the U.S. surgeon general, William Stewart, felt confident \nenough to declare: \u201cThe time has come to close the book on infectious diseases. We have \nbasically wiped out infection in the United States.\u201d Even as he spoke, however, some 90 \npercent of those strains were in the process of developing immunity to penicillin. Soon one of \nthese new strains, called Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, began to show up in \nhospitals. Only one type of antibiotic, vancomycin, remained effective against it, but in 1997 \na hospital in Tokyo reported the appearance of a strain that could resist even that. Within \nmonths it had spread to six other Japanese hospitals. All over, the microbes are beginning to \nwin the war again: in U.S. hospitals alone, some fourteen thousand people a year die from \ninfections they pick up there. As James Surowiecki has noted, given a choice between \ndeveloping antibiotics that people will take every day for two weeks or antidepressants that \npeople will take every day forever, drug companies not surprisingly opt for the latter. \nAlthough a few antibiotics have been toughened up a bit, the pharmaceutical industry hasn\u2019t \ngiven us an entirely new antibiotic since the 1970s. \n    Our carelessness is all the more alarming since the discovery that many other ailments may \nbe bacterial in origin. The process of discovery began in 1983 when Barry Marshall, a doctor \nin Perth, Western Australia, found that many stomach cancers and most stomach ulcers are \ncaused by a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. Even though his findings were easily tested, \nthe notion was so radical that more than a decade would pass before they were generally \naccepted. America\u2019s National Institutes of Health, for instance, didn\u2019t officially endorse the \nidea until 1994. \u201cHundreds, even thousands of people must have died from ulcers who \nwouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Marshall told a reporter from Forbes in 1999. \n    Since then further research has shown that there is or may well be a bacterial component in \nall kinds of other disorders\u2014heart disease, asthma, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, several types \nof mental disorders, many cancers, even, it has been suggested (inScience no less), obesity. \nThe day may not be far off when we desperately require an effective antibiotic and haven\u2019t \ngot one to call on. \n    It may come as a slight comfort to know that bacteria can themselves get sick. They are \nsometimes infected by bacteriophages (or simply phages), a type of virus. A virus is a strange \nand unlovely entity\u2014\u201ca piece of nucleic acid surrounded by bad news\u201d in the memorable \nphrase of the Nobel laureate Peter Medawar. Smaller and simpler than bacteria, viruses aren\u2019t \nthemselves alive. In isolation they are inert and harmless. But introduce them into a suitable \nhost and they burst into busyness\u2014into life. About five thousand types of virus are known, \nand between them they afflict us with many hundreds of diseases, ranging from the flu and \ncommon cold to those that are most invidious to human well-being: smallpox, rabies, yellow \nfever, ebola, polio, and the human immunodeficiency virus, the source of AIDS. \n    Viruses prosper by hijacking the genetic material of a living cell and using it to produce \nmore virus. They reproduce in a fanatical manner, then burst out in search of more cells to \ninvade. Not being living organisms themselves, they can afford to be very simple. Many, \nincluding HIV, have ten genes or fewer, whereas even the simplest bacteria require several \nthousand. They are also very tiny, much too small to be seen with a conventional microscope. \nIt wasn\u2019t until 1943 and the invention of the electron microscope that science got its first look \nat them. But they can do immense damage. Smallpox in the twentieth century alone killed an \nestimated 300 million people.They also have an unnerving capacity to burst upon the world in some new and startling \nform and then to vanish again as quickly as they came. In 1916, in one such case, people in \nEurope and America began to come down with a strange sleeping sickness, which became \nknown as encephalitis lethargica. Victims would go to sleep and not wake up. They could be \nroused without great difficulty to take food or go to the lavatory, and would answer questions \nsensibly\u2014they knew who and where they were\u2014though their manner was always apathetic. \n    However, the moment they were permitted to rest, they would sink at once back into \ndeepest slumber and remain in that state for as long as they were left. Some went on in this \nmanner for months before dying. A very few survived and regained consciousness but not \ntheir former liveliness. They existed in a state of profound apathy, \u201clike extinct volcanoes,\u201d in \nthe words of one doctor. In ten years the disease killed some five million people and then \nquietly went away. It didn\u2019t get much lasting attention because in the meantime an even worse \nepidemic\u2014indeed, the worst in history\u2014swept across the world. \n    It is sometimes called the Great Swine Flu epidemic and sometimes the Great Spanish Flu \nepidemic, but in either case it was ferocious. World War I killed twenty-one million people in \nfour years; swine flu did the same in its first four months. Almost 80 percent of American \ncasualties in the First World War came not from enemy fire, but from flu. In some units the \nmortality rate was as high as 80 percent. \n    Swine flu arose as a normal, nonlethal flu in the spring of 1918, but somehow over the \nfollowing months\u2014no one knows how or where\u2014it mutated into something more severe. A \nfifth of victims suffered only mild symptoms, but the rest became gravely ill and often died. \nSome succumbed within hours; others held on for a few days. \n    In the United States, the first deaths were recorded among sailors in Boston in late August \n1918, but the epidemic quickly spread to all parts of the country. Schools closed, public \nentertainments were shut down, people everywhere wore masks. It did little good. Between \nthe autumn of 1918 and spring of the following year, 548,452 people died of the flu in \nAmerica. The toll in Britain was 220,000, with similar numbers dead in France and Germany. \nNo one knows the global toll, as records in the Third World were often poor, but it was not \nless than 20 million and probably more like 50 million. Some estimates have put the global \ntotal as high as 100 million. \n    In an attempt to devise a vaccine, medical authorities conducted tests on volunteers at a \nmilitary prison on Deer Island in Boston Harbor. The prisoners were promised pardons if they \nsurvived a battery of tests. These tests were rigorous to say the least. First the subjects were \ninjected with infected lung tissue taken from the dead and then sprayed in the eyes, nose, and \nmouth with infectious aerosols. If they still failed to succumb, they had their throats swabbed \nwith discharges taken from the sick and dying. If all else failed, they were required to sit \nopen-mouthed while a gravely ill victim was helped to cough into their faces. \n    Out of\u2014somewhat amazingly\u2014three hundred men who volunteered, the doctors chose \nsixty-two for the tests. None contracted the flu\u2014not one. The only person who did grow ill \nwas the ward doctor, who swiftly died. The probable explanation for this is that the epidemic \nhad passed through the prison a few weeks earlier and the volunteers, all of whom had \nsurvived that visitation, had a natural immunity. \n    Much about the 1918 flu is understood poorly or not at all. One mystery is how it erupted \nsuddenly, all over, in places separated by oceans, mountain ranges, and other earthlyimpediments. A virus can survive for no more than a few hours outside a host body, so how \ncould it appear in Madrid, Bombay, and Philadelphia all in the same week? \n    The probable answer is that it was incubated and spread by people who had only slight \nsymptoms or none at all. Even in normal outbreaks, about 10 percent of people have the flu \nbut are unaware of it because they experience no ill effects. And because they remain in \ncirculation they tend to be the great spreaders of the disease. \n    That would account for the 1918 outbreak\u2019s widespread distribution, but it still doesn\u2019t \nexplain how it managed to lay low for several months before erupting so explosively at more \nor less the same time all over. Even more mysterious is that it was primarily devastating to \npeople in the prime of life. Flu normally is hardest on infants and the elderly, but in the 1918 \noutbreak deaths were overwhelmingly among people in their twenties and thirties. Older \npeople may have benefited from resistance gained from an earlier exposure to the same strain, \nbut why the very young were similarly spared is unknown. The greatest mystery of all is why \nthe 1918 flu was so ferociously deadly when most flus are not. We still have no idea. \n    From time to time certain strains of virus return. A disagreeable Russian virus known as \nH1N1 caused severe outbreaks over wide areas in 1933, then again in the 1950s, and yet again \nin the 1970s. Where it went in the meantime each time is uncertain. One suggestion is that \nviruses hide out unnoticed in populations of wild animals before trying their hand at a new \ngeneration of humans. No one can rule out the possibility that the Great Swine Flu epidemic \nmight once again rear its head. \n    And if it doesn\u2019t, others well might. New and frightening viruses crop up all the time. \nEbola, Lassa, and Marburg fevers all have tended to flare up and die down again, but no one \ncan say that they aren\u2019t quietly mutating away somewhere, or simply awaiting the right \nopportunity to burst forth in a catastrophic manner. It is now apparent that AIDS has been \namong us much longer than anyone originally suspected. Researchers at the Manchester \nRoyal Infirmary in England discovered that a sailor who had died of mysterious, untreatable \ncauses in 1959 in fact had AIDS. But for whatever reasons the disease remained generally \nquiescent for another twenty years. \n    The miracle is that other such diseases haven\u2019t gone rampant. Lassa fever, which wasn\u2019t \nfirst detected until 1969, in West Africa, is extremely virulent and little understood. In 1969, a \ndoctor at a Yale University lab in New Haven, Connecticut, who was studying Lassa fever \ncame down with it. He survived, but, more alarmingly, a technician in a nearby lab, with no \ndirect exposure, also contracted the disease and died. \n    Happily the outbreak stopped there, but we can\u2019t count on such good fortune always. Our \nlifestyles invite epidemics. Air travel makes it possible to spread infectious agents across the \nplanet with amazing ease. An ebola virus could begin the day in, say, Benin, and finish it in \nNew York or Hamburg or Nairobi, or all three. It means also that medical authorities \nincreasingly need to be acquainted with pretty much every malady that exists everywhere, but \nof course they are not. In 1990, a Nigerian living in Chicago was exposed to Lassa fever on a \nvisit to his homeland, but didn\u2019t develop symptoms until he had returned to the United States. \nHe died in a Chicago hospital without diagnosis and without anyone taking any special \nprecautions in treating him, unaware that he had one of the most lethal and infectious diseases \non the planet. Miraculously, no one else was infected. We may not be so lucky next time. \n    And on that sobering note, it\u2019s time to return to the world of the visibly living.", "21": "21    LIFE GOES ON \n \n \n \n \nIT ISN\u2019T EASY to become a fossil. The fate of nearly all living organisms\u2014over 99.9 \npercent of them\u2014is to compost down to nothingness. When your spark is gone, every \nmolecule you own will be nibbled off you or sluiced away to be put to use in some other \nsystem. That\u2019s just the way it is. Even if you make it into the small pool of organisms, the less \nthan 0.1 percent, that don\u2019t get devoured, the chances of being fossilized are very small. \n    In order to become a fossil, several things must happen. First, you must die in the right \nplace. Only about 15 percent of rocks can preserve fossils, so it\u2019s no good keeling over on a \nfuture site of granite. In practical terms the deceased must become buried in sediment, where \nit can leave an impression, like a leaf in wet mud, or decompose without exposure to oxygen, \npermitting the molecules in its bones and hard parts (and very occasionally softer parts) to be \nreplaced by dissolved minerals, creating a petrified copy of the original. Then as the \nsediments in which the fossil lies are carelessly pressed and folded and pushed about by \nEarth\u2019s processes, the fossil must somehow maintain an identifiable shape. Finally, but above \nall, after tens of millions or perhaps hundreds of millions of years hidden away, it must be \nfound and recognized as something worth keeping. \n    Only about one bone in a billion, it is thought, ever becomes fossilized. If that is so, it \nmeans that the complete fossil legacy of all the Americans alive today\u2014that\u2019s 270 million \npeople with 206 bones each\u2014will only be about fifty bones, one quarter of a complete \nskeleton. That\u2019s not to say of course that any of these bones will actually be found. Bearing in \nmind that they can be buried anywhere within an area of slightly over 3.6 million square \nmiles, little of which will ever be turned over, much less examined, it would be something of \na miracle if they were. Fossils are in every sense vanishingly rare. Most of what has lived on \nEarth has left behind no record at all. It has been estimated that less than one species in ten \nthousand has made it into the fossil record. That in itself is a stunningly infinitesimal \nproportion. However, if you accept the common estimate that the Earth has produced 30 \nbillion species of creature in its time and Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin\u2019s statement (in \nThe Sixth Extinction ) that there are 250,000 species of creature in the fossil record, that \nreduces the proportion to just one in 120,000. Either way, what we possess is the merest \nsampling of all the life that Earth has spawned. \n    Moreover, the record we do have is hopelessly skewed. Most land animals, of course, don\u2019t \ndie in sediments. They drop in the open and are eaten or left to rot or weather down to \nnothing. The fossil record consequently is almost absurdly biased in favor of marine creatures. \nAbout 95 percent of all the fossils we possess are of animals that once lived under water, \nmostly in shallow seas.I mention all this to explain why on a gray day in February I went to the Natural History \nMuseum in London to meet a cheerful, vaguely rumpled, very likeable paleontologist named \nRichard Fortey. \n    Fortey knows an awful lot about an awful lot. He is the author of a wry, splendid book \ncalled Life: An Unauthorised Biography, which covers the whole pageant of animate creation. \nBut his first love is a type of marine creature called trilobites that once teemed in Ordovician \nseas but haven\u2019t existed for a long time except in fossilized form. All shared a basic body plan \nof three parts, or lobes\u2014head, tail, thorax\u2014from which comes the name. Fortey found his \nfirst when he was a boy clambering over rocks at St. David\u2019s Bay in Wales. He was hooked  \nfor life. \n   He took me to a gallery of tall metal cupboards. Each cupboard was filled with shallow \ndrawers, and each drawer was filled with stony trilobites\u2014twenty thousand specimens in all. \n   \u201cIt seems like a big number,\u201d he agreed, \u201cbut you have to remember that millions upon \nmillions of trilobites lived for millions upon millions of years in ancient seas, so twenty \nthousand isn\u2019t a huge number. And most of these are only partial specimens. Finding a \ncomplete trilobite fossil is still a big moment for a paleontologist.\u201d \n   Trilobites first appeared\u2014fully formed, seemingly from nowhere\u2014about 540 million years \nago, near the start of the great outburst of complex life popularly known as the Cambrian \nexplosion, and then vanished, along with a great deal else, in the great and still mysterious \nPermian extinction 300,000 or so centuries later. As with all extinct creatures, there is a \nnatural temptation to regard them as failures, but in fact they were among the most successful \nanimals ever to live. Their reign ran for 300 million years\u2014twice the span of dinosaurs, \nwhich were themselves one of history\u2019s great survivors. Humans, Fortey points out, have \nsurvived so far for one-half of 1 percent as long. \n   With so much time at their disposal, the trilobites proliferated prodigiously. Most remained \nsmall, about the size of modern beetles, but some grew to be as big as platters. Altogether \nthey formed at least five thousand genera and sixty thousand species\u2014though more turn up \nall the time. Fortey had recently been at a conference in South America where he was \napproached by an academic from a small provincial university in Argentina. \u201cShe had a box \nthat was full of interesting things\u2014trilobites that had never been seen before in South \nAmerica, or indeed anywhere, and a great deal else. She had no research facilities to study \nthem and no funds to look for more. Huge parts of the world are still unexplored.\u201d \n   \u201cIn terms of trilobites?\u201d \n   \u201cNo, in terms of everything.\u201d \n  \n   Throughout the nineteenth century, trilobites were almost the only known forms of early \ncomplex life, and for that reason were assiduously collected and studied. The big mystery \nabout them was their sudden appearance. Even now, as Fortey says, it can be startling to go to \nthe right formation of rocks and to work your way upward through the eons finding no visible \nlife at all, and then suddenly \u201ca whole Profallotaspis or Elenellus as big as a crab will pop \ninto your waiting hands.\u201d These were creatures with limbs, gills, nervous systems, probing \nantennae, \u201ca brain of sorts,\u201d in Fortey\u2019s words, and the strangest eyes ever seen. Made ofcalcite rods, the same stuff that forms limestone, they constituted the earliest visual systems \nknown. More than this, the earliest trilobites didn\u2019t consist of just one venturesome species \nbut dozens, and didn\u2019t appear in one or two locations but all over. Many thinking people in \nthe nineteenth century saw this as proof of God\u2019s handiwork and refutation of Darwin\u2019s \nevolutionary ideals. If evolution proceeded slowly, they asked, then how did he account for \nthis sudden appearance of complex, fully formed creatures? The fact is, he couldn\u2019t. \n    And so matters seemed destined to remain forever until one day in 1909, three months shy \nof the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Darwin\u2019s On the Origin of Species , when a \npaleontologist named Charles Doolittle Walcott made an extraordinary find in the Canadian \nRockies. \n    Walcott was born in 1850 and grew up near Utica, New York, in a family of modest means, \nwhich became more modest still with the sudden death of his father when Walcott was an \ninfant. As a boy Walcott discovered that he had a knack for finding fossils, particularly \ntrilobites, and built up a collection of sufficient distinction that it was bought by Louis \nAgassiz for his museum at Harvard for a small fortune\u2014about $70,000 in today\u2019s money. \nAlthough he had barely a high school education and was self taught in the sciences, Walcott \nbecame a leading authority on trilobites and was the first person to establish that trilobites \nwere arthropods, the group that includes modern insects and crustaceans. \n    In 1879 he took a job as a field researcher with the newly formed United States Geological \nSurvey and served with such distinction that within fifteen years he had risen to be its head. In \n1907 he was appointed secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, where he remained until his \ndeath in 1927. Despite his administrative obligations, he continued to do fieldwork and to \nwrite prolifically. \u201cHis books fill a library shelf,\u201d according to Fortey. Not incidentally, he \nwas also a founding director of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, which \neventually became the National Aeronautics and Space Agency, or NASA, and thus can \nrightly be considered the grandfather of the space age. \n    But what he is remembered for now is an astute but lucky find in British Columbia, high \nabove the little town of Field, in the late summer of 1909. The customary version of the story \nis that Walcott, accompanied by his wife, was riding on horseback on a mountain trail beneath \nthe spot called the Burgess Ridge when his wife\u2019s horse slipped on loose stones. Dismounting \nto assist her, Walcott discovered that the horse had turned a slab of shale that contained fossil \ncrustaceans of an especially ancient and unusual type. Snow was falling\u2014winter comes early \nto the Canadian Rockies\u2014so they didn\u2019t linger, but the next year at the first opportunity \nWalcott returned to the spot. Tracing the presumed route of the rocks\u2019 slide, he climbed 750 \nfeet to near the mountain\u2019s summit. There, 8,000 feet above sea level, he found a shale \noutcrop, about the length of a city block, containing an unrivaled array of fossils from soon \nafter the moment when complex life burst forth in dazzling profusion\u2014the famous Cambrian \nexplosion. Walcott had found, in effect, the holy grail of paleontology. The outcrop became \nknown as the Burgess Shale, and for a long time it provided \u201cour sole vista upon the inception \nof modern life in all its fullness,\u201d as the late Stephen Jay Gould recorded in his popular book \nWonderful Life . \n    Gould, ever scrupulous, discovered from reading Walcott\u2019s diaries that the story of the \nBurgess Shale\u2019s discovery appears to have been somewhat embroidered\u2014Walcott makes no \nmention of a slipping horse or falling snow\u2014but there is no disputing that it was an \nextraordinary find.It is almost impossible for us whose time on Earth is limited to a breezy few decades to \nappreciate how remote in time from us the Cambrian outburst was. If you could fly backwards \ninto the past at the rate of one year per second, it would take you about half an hour to reach \nthe time of Christ, and a little over three weeks to get back to the beginnings of human life. \nBut it would take you twenty years to reach the dawn of the Cambrian period. It was, in other \nwords, an extremely long time ago, and the world was a very different place. \n    For one thing, 500-million-plus years ago when the Burgess Shale was formed it wasn\u2019t at \nthe top of a mountain but at the foot of one. Specifically it was a shallow ocean basin at the \nbottom of a steep cliff. The seas of that time teemed with life, but normally the animals left no \nrecord because they were soft-bodied and decayed upon dying. But at Burgess the cliff \ncollapsed, and the creatures below, entombed in a mudslide, were pressed like flowers in a \nbook, their features preserved in wondrous detail. \n    In annual summer trips from 1910 to 1925 (by which time he was seventy-five years old), \nWalcott excavated tens of thousands of specimens (Gould says 80,000; the normally \nunimpeachable fact checkers of National Georgraphic say 60,000), which he brought back to \nWashington for further study. In both sheer numbers and diversity the collection was \nunparalleled. Some of the Burgess fossils had shells; many others did not. Some were sighted, \nothers blind. The variety was enormous, consisting of 140 species by one count. \u201cThe Burgess \nShale included a range of disparity in anatomical designs never again equaled, and not \nmatched today by all the creatures in the world\u2019s oceans,\u201d Gould wrote. \n    Unfortunately, according to Gould, Walcott failed to discern the significance of what he \nhad found. \u201cSnatching defeat from the jaws of victory,\u201d Gould wrote in another work, Eight \nLittle Piggies, \u201cWalcott then proceeded to misinterpret these magnificent fossils in the deepest \npossible way.\u201d He placed them into modern groups, making them ancestral to today\u2019s worms, \njellyfish, and other creatures, and thus failed to appreciate their distinctness. \u201cUnder such an \ninterpretation,\u201d Gould sighed, \u201clife began in primordial simplicity and moved inexorably, \npredictably onward to more and better.\u201d \n    Walcott died in 1927 and the Burgess fossils were largely forgotten. For nearly half a \ncentury they stayed shut away in drawers in the American Museum of Natural History in \nWashington, seldom consulted and never questioned. Then in 1973 a graduate student from \nCambridge University named Simon Conway Morris paid a visit to the collection. He was \nastonished by what he found. The fossils were far more varied and magnificent than Walcott \nhad indicated in his writings. In taxonomy the category that describes the basic body plans of \nall organisms is the phylum, and here, Conway Morris concluded, were drawer after drawer of \nsuch anatomical singularities\u2014all amazingly and unaccountably unrecognized by the man \nwho had found them. \n    With his supervisor, Harry Whittington, and fellow graduate student Derek Briggs, Conway \nMorris spent the next several years making a systematic revision of the entire collection, and \ncranking out one exciting monograph after another as discovery piled upon discovery. Many \nof the creatures employed body plans that were not simply unlike anything seen before or \nsince, but were bizarrely different. One, Opabinia, had five eyes and a nozzle-like snout with \nclaws on the end. Another, a disc-shaped being called Peytoia, looked almost comically like a \npineapple slice. A third had evidently tottered about on rows of stilt-like legs, and was so odd \nthat they named it Hallucigenia. There was so much unrecognized novelty in the collection \nthat at one point upon opening a new drawer Conway Morris famously was heard to mutter, \n\u201cOh fuck, not another phylum.\u201dThe English team\u2019s revisions showed that the Cambrian had been a time of unparalleled \ninnovation and experimentation in body designs. For almost four billion years life had \ndawdled along without any detectable ambitions in the direction of complexity, and then \nsuddenly, in the space of just five or ten million years, it had created all the basic body \ndesigns still in use today. Name a creature, from a nematode worm to Cameron Diaz, and they \nall use architecture first created in the Cambrian party. \n    What was most surprising, however, was that there were so many body designs that had \nfailed to make the cut, so to speak, and left no descendants. Altogether, according to Gould, at \nleast fifteen and perhaps as many as twenty of the Burgess animals belonged to no recognized \nphylum. (The number soon grew in some popular accounts to as many as one hundred\u2014far \nmore than the Cambridge scientists ever actually claimed.) \u201cThe history of life,\u201d wrote Gould, \n\u201cis a story of massive removal followed by differentiation within a few surviving stocks, not \nthe conventional tale of steadily increasing excellence, complexity, and diversity.\u201d \nEvolutionary success, it appeared, was a lottery. \n    One creature thatdid manage to slip through, a small wormlike being called Pikaia \ngracilens, was found to have a primitive spinal column, making it the earliest known ancestor \nof all later vertebrates, including us.Pikaia were by no means abundant among the Burgess \nfossils, so goodness knows how close they may have come to extinction. Gould, in a famous \nquotation, leaves no doubt that he sees our lineal success as a fortunate fluke: \u201cWind back the \ntape of life to the early days of the Burgess Shale; let it play again from an identical starting \npoint, and the chance becomes vanishingly small that anything like human intelligence would \ngrace the replay.\u201d \n    Gould\u2019s book was published in 1989 to general critical acclaim and was a great commercial \nsuccess. What wasn\u2019t generally known was that many scientists didn\u2019t agree with Gould\u2019s \nconclusions at all, and that it was all soon to get very ugly. In the context of the Cambrian, \n\u201cexplosion\u201d would soon have more to do with modern tempers than ancient physiological \nfacts. \n  \n    In fact, we now know, complex organisms existed at least a hundred million years before \nthe Cambrian. We should have known a whole lot sooner. Nearly forty years after Walcott \nmade his discovery in Canada, on the other side of the planet in Australia, a young geologist \nnamed Reginald Sprigg found something even older and in its way just as remarkable. \n    In 1946 Sprigg was a young assistant government geologist for the state of South Australia \nwhen he was sent to make a survey of abandoned mines in the Ediacaran Hills of the Flinders \nRange, an expanse of baking outback some three hundred miles north of Adelaide. The idea \nwas to see if there were any old mines that might be profitably reworked using newer \ntechnologies, so he wasn\u2019t studying surface rocks at all, still less fossils. But one day while \neating his lunch, Sprigg idly overturned a hunk of sandstone and was surprised\u2014to put it \nmildly\u2014to see that the rock\u2019s surface was covered in delicate fossils, rather like the \nimpressions leaves make in mud. These rocks predated the Cambrian explosion. He was \nlooking at the dawn of visible life. \n    Sprigg submitted a paper to Nature , but it was turned down. He read it instead at the next \nannual meeting of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of \nScience, but it failed to find favor with the association\u2019s head, who said the Ediacaranimprints were merely \u201cfortuitous inorganic markings\u201d\u2014patterns made by wind or rain or \ntides, but not living beings. His hopes not yet entirely crushed, Sprigg traveled to London and \npresented his findings to the 1948 International Geological Congress, but failed to excite \neither interest or belief. Finally, for want of a better outlet, he published his findings in the \nTransactions of the Royal Society of South Australia. Then he quit his government job and \ntook up oil exploration. \n    Nine years later, in 1957, a schoolboy named John Mason, while walking through \nCharnwood Forest in the English Midlands, found a rock with a strange fossil in it, similar to \na modern sea pen and exactly like some of the specimens Sprigg had found and been trying to \ntell everyone about ever since. The schoolboy turned it in to a paleontologist at the University \nof Leicester, who identified it at once as Precambrian. Young Mason got his picture in the \npapers and was treated as a precocious hero; he still is in many books. The specimen was \nnamed in his honor Chamia masoni. \n    Today some of Sprigg\u2019s original Ediacaran specimens, along with many of the other fifteen \nhundred specimens that have been found throughout the Flinders Range since that time, can \nbe seen in a glass case in an upstairs room of the stout and lovely South Australian Museum \nin Adelaide, but they don\u2019t attract a great deal of attention. The delicately etched patterns are \nrather faint and not terribly arresting to the untrained eye. They are mostly small and disc-\nshaped, with occasional, vague trailing ribbons. Fortey has described them as \u201csoft-bodied \noddities.\u201d \n    There is still very little agreement about what these things were or how they lived. They \nhad, as far as can be told, no mouth or anus with which to take in and discharge digestive \nmaterials, and no internal organs with which to process them along the way. \u201cIn life,\u201d Fortey \nsays, \u201cmost of them probably simply lay upon the surface of the sandy sediment, like soft, \nstructureless and inanimate flatfish.\u201d At their liveliest, they were no more complex than \njellyfish. All the Ediacaran creatures were diploblastic, meaning they were built from two \nlayers of tissue. With the exception of jellyfish, all animals today are triploblastic. \n    Some experts think they weren\u2019t animals at all, but more like plants or fungi. The \ndistinctions between plant and animal are not always clear even now. The modern sponge \nspends its life fixed to a single spot and has no eyes or brain or beating heart, and yet is an \nanimal. \u201cWhen we go back to the Precambrian the differences between plants and animals \nwere probably even less clear,\u201d says Fortey. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any rule that says you have to be \ndemonstrably one or the other.\u201d \n    Nor is it agreed that the Ediacaran organisms are in any way ancestral to anything alive \ntoday (except possibly some jellyfish). Many authorities see them as a kind of failed \nexperiment, a stab at complexity that didn\u2019t take, possibly because the sluggish Ediacaran \norganisms were devoured or outcompeted by the lither and more sophisticated animals of the \nCambrian period. \n    \u201cThere is nothing closely similar alive today,\u201d Fortey has written. \u201cThey are difficult to \ninterpret as any kind of ancestors of what was to follow.\u201d \n    The feeling was that ultimately they weren\u2019t terribly important to the development of life \non Earth. Many authorities believe that there was a mass extermination at the Precambrian\u2013\nCambrian boundary and that all the Ediacaran creatures (except the uncertain jellyfish) failedto move on to the next phase. The real business of complex life, in other words, started with \nthe Cambrian explosion. That\u2019s how Gould saw it in any case. \n  \n    As for the revisions of the Burgess Shale fossils, almost at once people began to question \nthe interpretations and, in particular, Gould\u2019s interpretation of the interpretations. \u201cFrom the \nfirst there were a number of scientists who doubted the account that Steve Gould had \npresented, however much they admired the manner of its delivery,\u201d Fortey wrote in Life. That \nis putting it mildly. \n    \u201cIf only Stephen Gould could think as clearly as he writes!\u201d barked the Oxford academic \nRichard Dawkins in the opening line of a review (in the London Sunday Telegraph) of \nWonderful Life. Dawkins acknowledged that the book was \u201cunputdownable\u201d and a \u201cliterary \ntour-de-force,\u201d but accused Gould of engaging in a \u201cgrandiloquent and near-disingenuous\u201d \nmisrepresentation of the facts by suggesting that the Burgess revisions had stunned the \npaleontological community. \u201cThe view that he is attacking\u2014that evolution marches \ninexorably toward a pinnacle such as man\u2014has not been believed for 50 years,\u201d Dawkins \nfumed. \n    And yet that was exactly the conclusion to which many general reviewers were drawn. \nOne, writing in the New York Times Book Review, cheerfully suggested that as a result of \nGould\u2019s book scientists \u201chave been throwing out some preconceptions that they had not \nexamined for generations. They are, reluctantly or enthusiastically, accepting the idea that \nhumans are as much an accident of nature as a product of orderly development.\u201d \n    But the real heat directed at Gould arose from the belief that many of his conclusions were \nsimply mistaken or carelessly inflated. Writing in the journal Evolution, Dawkins attacked \nGould\u2019s assertions that \u201cevolution in the Cambrian was a different kind of process from \ntoday\u201d and expressed exasperation at Gould\u2019s repeated suggestions that \u201cthe Cambrian was a \nperiod of evolutionary \u2018experiment,\u2019 evolutionary \u2018trial and error,\u2019 evolutionary \u2018false starts.\u2019 . \n. . It was the fertile time when all the great \u2018fundamental body plans\u2019 were invented. \nNowadays, evolution just tinkers with old body plans. Back in the Cambrian, new phyla and \nnew classes arose. Nowadays we only get new species!\u201d \n    Noting how often this idea\u2014that there are no new body plans\u2014is picked up, Dawkins says: \n\u201cIt is as though a gardener looked at an oak tree and remarked, wonderingly: \u2018Isn\u2019t it strange \nthat no major new boughs have appeared on this tree for many years? These days, all the new \ngrowth appears to be at the twig level.\u2019 \u201d \n    \u201cIt was a strange time,\u201d Fortey says now, \u201cespecially when you reflected that this was all \nabout something that happened five hundred million years ago, but feelings really did run \nquite high. I joked in one of my books that I felt as if I ought to put a safety helmet on before \nwriting about the Cambrian period, but it did actually feel a bit like that.\u201d \n    Strangest of all was the response of one of the heroes of Wonderful Life, Simon Conway \nMorris, who startled many in the paleontological community by rounding abruptly on Gould \nin a book of his own, The Crucible of Creation. The book treated Gould \u201cwith contempt, even \nloathing,\u201d in Fortey\u2019s words. \u201cI have never encountered such spleen in a book by a \nprofessional,\u201d Fortey wrote later. \u201cThe casual reader of The Crucible of Creation, unaware ofthe history, would never gather that the author\u2019s views had once been close to (if not actually \nshared with) Gould\u2019s.\u201d \n    When I asked Fortey about it, he said: \u201cWell, it was very strange, quite shocking really, \nbecause Gould\u2019s portrayal of him had been so flattering. I could only assume that Simon was \nembarrassed. You know, science changes but books are permanent, and I suppose he regretted \nbeing so irremediably associated with views that he no longer altogether held. There was all \nthat stuff about \u2018oh fuck, another phylum\u2019 and I expect he regretted being famous for that.\u201d \n    What happened was that the early Cambrian fossils began to undergo a period of critical \nreappraisal. Fortey and Derek Briggs\u2014one of the other principals in Gould\u2019s book\u2014used a \nmethod known as cladistics to compare the various Burgess fossils. In simple terms, cladistics \nconsists of organizing organisms on the basis of shared features. Fortey gives as an example \nthe idea of comparing a shrew and an elephant. If you considered the elephant\u2019s large size and \nstriking trunk you might conclude that it could have little in common with a tiny, sniffing \nshrew. But if you compared both of them with a lizard, you would see that the elephant and \nshrew were in fact built to much the same plan. In essence, what Fortey is saying is that \nGould saw elephants and shrews where they saw mammals. The Burgess creatures, they \nbelieved, weren\u2019t as strange and various as they appeared at first sight. \u201cThey were often no \nstranger than trilobites,\u201d Fortey says now. \u201cIt is just that we have had a century or so to get \nused to trilobites. Familiarity, you know, breeds familiarity.\u201d \n    This wasn\u2019t, I should note, because of sloppiness or inattention. Interpreting the forms and \nrelationships of ancient animals on the basis of often distorted and fragmentary evidence is \nclearly a tricky business. Edward O. Wilson has noted that if you took selected species of \nmodern insects and presented them as Burgess-style fossils nobody would ever guess that they \nwere all from the same phylum, so different are their body plans. Also instrumental in helping \nrevisions were the discoveries of two further early Cambrian sites, one in Greenland and one \nin China, plus more scattered finds, which between them yielded many additional and often \nbetter specimens. \n    The upshot is that the Burgess fossils were found to be not so different after all. \nHallucigenia, it turned out, had been reconstructed upside down. Its stilt-like legs were \nactually spikes along its back. Peytoia, the weird creature that looked like a pineapple slice, \nwas found to be not a distinct creature but merely part of a larger animal called Anomalocaris. \nMany of the Burgess specimens have now been assigned to living phyla\u2014just where Walcott \nput them in the first place. Hallucigenia and some others are thought to be related to \nOnychophora, a group of caterpillar-like animals. Others have been reclassified as precursors \nof the modern annelids. In fact, says Fortey, \u201cthere are relatively few Cambrian designs that \nare wholly novel. More often they turn out to be just interesting elaborations of well-\nestablished designs.\u201d As he wrote in his book Life: \u201cNone was as strange as a present day \nbarnacle, nor as grotesque as a queen termite.\u201d \n    So the Burgess Shale specimens weren\u2019t so spectacular after all. This made them, as Fortey \nhas written, \u201cno less interesting, or odd, just more explicable.\u201d Their weird body plans were \njust a kind of youthful exuberance\u2014the evolutionary equivalent, as it were, of spiked hair and \ntongue studs. Eventually the forms settled into a staid and stable middle age. \n    But that still left the enduring question of where all these animals had come from\u2014how \nthey had suddenly appeared from out of nowhere.Alas, it turns out the Cambrian explosion may not have been quite so explosive as all that. \nThe Cambrian animals, it is now thought, were probably there all along, but were just too \nsmall to see. Once again it was trilobites that provided the clue\u2014in particular that seemingly \nmystifying appearance of different types of trilobite in widely scattered locations around the \nglobe, all at more or less the same time. \n    On the face of it, the sudden appearance of lots of fully formed but varied creatures would \nseem to enhance the miraculousness of the Cambrian outburst, but in fact it did the opposite. \nIt is one thing to have one well-formed creature like a trilobite burst forth in isolation\u2014that \nreally is a wonder\u2014but to have many of them, all distinct but clearly related, turning up \nsimultaneously in the fossil record in places as far apart as China and New York clearly \nsuggests that we are missing a big part of their history. There could be no stronger evidence \nthat they simply had to have a forebear\u2014some grandfather species that started the line in a \nmuch earlier past. \n    And the reason we haven\u2019t found these earlier species, it is now thought, is that they were \ntoo tiny to be preserved. Says Fortey: \u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary to be big to be a perfectly \nfunctioning, complex organism. The sea swarms with tiny arthropods today that have left no \nfossil record.\u201d He cites the little copepod, which numbers in the trillions in modern seas and \nclusters in shoals large enough to turn vast areas of the ocean black, and yet our total \nknowledge of its ancestry is a single specimen found in the body of an ancient fossilized fish. \n    \u201cThe Cambrian explosion, if that\u2019s the word for it, probably was more an increase in size \nthan a sudden appearance of new body types,\u201d Fortey says. \u201cAnd it could have happened quite \nswiftly, so in that sense I suppose it was an explosion.\u201d The idea is that just as mammals \nbided their time for a hundred million years until the dinosaurs cleared off and then seemingly \nburst forth in profusion all over the planet, so too perhaps the arthropods and other triploblasts \nwaited in semimicroscopic anonymity for the dominant Ediacaran organisms to have their \nday. Says Fortey: \u201cWe know that mammals increased in size quite dramatically after the \ndinosaurs went\u2014though when I say quite abruptly I of course mean it in a geological sense. \nWe\u2019re still talking millions of years.\u201d \n    Incidentally, Reginald Sprigg did eventually get a measure of overdue credit. One of the \nmain early genera, Spriggina, was named in his honor, as were several species, and the whole \nbecame known as the Ediacaran fauna after the hills through which he had searched. By this \ntime, however, Sprigg\u2019s fossil-hunting days were long over. After leaving geology he founded \na successful oil company and eventually retired to an estate in his beloved Flinders Range, \nwhere he created a wildlife reserve. He died in 1994 a rich man.", "22": "22    GOOD-BYE TO ALL THAT \n \n \n \nWHEN YOU CONSIDER it from a human perspective, and clearly it would be difficult for \nus to do otherwise, life is an odd thing. It couldn\u2019t wait to get going, but then, having gotten \ngoing, it seemed in very little hurry to move on. \n    Consider the lichen. Lichens are just about the hardiest visible organisms on Earth, but \namong the least ambitious. They will grow happily enough in a sunny churchyard, but they \nparticularly thrive in environments where no other organism would go\u2014on blowy \nmountaintops and arctic wastes, wherever there is little but rock and rain and cold, and almost \nno competition. In areas of Antarctica where virtually nothing else will grow, you can find \nvast expanses of lichen\u2014four hundred types of them\u2014adhering devotedly to every wind-\nwhipped rock. \n    For a long time, people couldn\u2019t understand how they did it. Because lichens grew on bare \nrock without evident nourishment or the production of seeds, many people\u2014educated \npeople\u2014believed they were stones caught in the process of becoming plants. \u201cSpontaneously, \ninorganic stone becomes living plant!\u201d rejoiced one observer, a Dr. Homschuch, in 1819. \n    Closer inspection showed that lichens were more interesting than magical. They are in fact \na partnership between fungi and algae. The fungi excrete acids that dissolve the surface of the \nrock, freeing minerals that the algae convert into food sufficient to sustain both. It is not a \nvery exciting arrangement, but it is a conspicuously successful one. The world has more than \ntwenty thousand species of lichens. \n    Like most things that thrive in harsh environments, lichens are slow-growing. It may take a \nlichen more than half a century to attain the dimensions of a shirt button. Those the size of \ndinner plates, writes David Attenborough, are therefore \u201clikely to be hundreds if not \nthousands of years old.\u201d It would be hard to imagine a less fulfilling existence. \u201cThey simply \nexist,\u201d Attenborough adds, \u201ctestifying to the moving fact that life even at its simplest level \noccurs, apparently, just for its own sake.\u201d \n    It is easy to overlook this thought that life just is. As humans we are inclined to feel that life \nmust have a point. We have plans and aspirations and desires. We want to take constant \nadvantage of all the intoxicating existence we\u2019ve been endowed with. But what\u2019s life to a \nlichen? Yet its impulse to exist, to be, is every bit as strong as ours\u2014arguably even stronger. \nIf I were told that I had to spend decades being a furry growth on a rock in the woods, I \nbelieve I would lose the will to go on. Lichens don\u2019t. Like virtually all living things, they will \nsuffer any hardship, endure any insult, for a moment\u2019s additional existence. Life, in short, just \nwants to be. But\u2014and here\u2019s an interesting point\u2014for the most part it doesn\u2019t want to be \nmuch. \n    This is perhaps a little odd because life has had plenty of time to develop ambitions. If you \nimagine the 4,500-billion-odd years of Earth\u2019s history compressed into a normal earthly day, \nthen life begins very early, about 4A.M., with the rise of the first simple, single-celledorganisms, but then advances no further for the next sixteen hours. Not until almost 8:30 in \nthe evening, with the day five-sixths over, has Earth anything to show the universe but a \nrestless skin of microbes. Then, finally, the first sea plants appear, followed twenty minutes \nlater by the first jellyfish and the enigmatic Ediacaran fauna first seen by Reginald Sprigg in \nAustralia. At 9:04P.M. trilobites swim onto the scene, followed more or less immediately by \nthe shapely creatures of the Burgess Shale. Just before 10P.M. plants begin to pop up on the \nland. Soon after, with less than two hours left in the day, the first land creatures follow. \n    Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather, by 10:24 the Earth is covered in the great \ncarboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal, and the first winged insects are \nevident. Dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before 11P.M. and hold sway for about three-\nquarters of an hour. At twenty-one minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals \nbegins. Humans emerge one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight. The whole of our \nrecorded history, on this scale, would be no more than a few seconds, a single human lifetime \nbarely an instant. Throughout this greatly speeded-up day continents slide about and bang \ntogether at a clip that seems positively reckless. Mountains rise and melt away, ocean basins \ncome and go, ice sheets advance and withdraw. And throughout the whole, about three times \nevery minute, somewhere on the planet there is a flashbulb pop of light marking the impact of \na Manson-sized meteor or one even larger. It\u2019s a wonder that anything at all can survive in \nsuch a pummeled and unsettled environment. In fact, not many things do for long. \n    Perhaps an even more effective way of grasping our extreme recentness as a part of this \n4.5-billion-year-old picture is to stretch your arms to their fullest extent and imagine that \nwidth as the entire history of the Earth. On this scale, according to John McPhee in Basin and \nRange, the distance from the fingertips of one hand to the wrist of the other is Precambrian. \nAll of complex life is in one hand, \u201cand in a single stroke with a medium-grained nail file you \ncould eradicate human history.\u201d \n    Fortunately, that moment hasn\u2019t happened, but the chances are good that it will. I don\u2019t \nwish to interject a note of gloom just at this point, but the fact is that there is one other \nextremely pertinent quality about life on Earth: it goes extinct. Quite regularly. For all the \ntrouble they take to assemble and preserve themselves, species crumple and die remarkably \nroutinely. And the more complex they get, the more quickly they appear to go extinct. Which \nis perhaps one reason why so much of life isn\u2019t terribly ambitious. \n  \n    So anytime life does something bold it is quite an event, and few occasions were more \neventful than when life moved on to the next stage in our narrative and came out of the sea. \n    Land was a formidable environment: hot, dry, bathed in intense ultraviolet radiation, \nlacking the buoyancy that makes movement in water comparatively effortless. To live on \nland, creatures had to undergo wholesale revisions of their anatomies. Hold a fish at each end \nand it sags in the middle, its backbone too weak to support it. To survive out of water, marine \ncreatures needed to come up with new load-bearing internal architecture\u2014not the sort of \nadjustment that happens overnight. Above all and most obviously, any land creature would \nhave to develop a way to take its oxygen directly from the air rather than filter it from water. \nThese were not trivial challenges to overcome. On the other hand, there was a powerful \nincentive to leave the water: it was getting dangerous down there. The slow fusion of the \ncontinents into a single landmass, Pangaea, meant there was much, much less coastline than \nformerly and thus much less coastal habitat. So competition was fierce. There was also anomnivorous and unsettling new type of predator on the scene, one so perfectly designed for \nattack that it has scarcely changed in all the long eons since its emergence: the shark. Never \nwould there be a more propitious time to find an alternative environment to water. \n    Plants began the process of land colonization about 450 million years ago, accompanied of \nnecessity by tiny mites and other organisms that they needed to break down and recycle dead \norganic matter on their behalf. Larger animals took a little longer to emerge, but by about 400 \nmillion years ago they were venturing out of the water, too. Popular illustrations have \nencouraged us to envision the first venturesome land dwellers as a kind of ambitious fish\u2014\nsomething like the modern mudskipper, which can hop from puddle to puddle during \ndroughts\u2014or even as a fully formed amphibian. In fact, the first visible mobile residents on \ndry land were probably much more like modern wood lice, sometimes also known as pillbugs \nor sow bugs. These are the little bugs (crustaceans, in fact) that are commonly thrown into \nconfusion when you upturn a rock or log. \n    For those that learned to breathe oxygen from the air, times were good. Oxygen levels in \nthe Devonian and Carboniferous periods, when terrestrial life first bloomed, were as high as \n35 percent (as opposed to nearer 20 percent now). This allowed animals to grow remarkably \nlarge remarkably quickly. \n    And how, you may reasonably wonder, can scientists know what oxygen levels were like \nhundreds of millions of years ago? The answer lies in a slightly obscure but ingenious field \nknown as isotope geochemistry. The long-ago seas of the Carboniferous and Devonian \nswarmed with tiny plankton that wrapped themselves inside tiny protective shells. Then, as \nnow, the plankton created their shells by drawing oxygen from the atmosphere and combining \nit with other elements (carbon especially) to form durable compounds such as calcium \ncarbonate. It\u2019s the same chemical trick that goes on in (and is discussed elsewhere in relation \nto) the long-term carbon cycle\u2014a process that doesn\u2019t make for terribly exciting narrative but \nis vital for creating a livable planet. \n    Eventually in this process all the tiny organisms die and drift to the bottom of the sea, \nwhere they are slowly compressed into limestone. Among the tiny atomic structures the \nplankton take to the grave with them are two very stable isotopes\u2014oxygen-16 and oxygen-18. \n(If you have forgotten what an isotope is, it doesn\u2019t matter, though for the record it\u2019s an atom \nwith an abnormal number of neutrons.) This is where the geochemists come in, for the \nisotopes accumulate at different rates depending on how much oxygen or carbon dioxide is in \nthe atmosphere at the time of their creation. By comparing these ancient ratios, the \ngeochemists can cunningly read conditions in the ancient world\u2014oxygen levels, air and ocean \ntemperatures, the extent and timing of ice ages, and much else. By combining their isotope \nfindings with other fossil residues\u2014pollen levels and so on\u2014scientists can, with considerable \nconfidence, re-create entire landscapes that no human eye ever saw. \n    The principal reason oxygen levels were able to build up so robustly throughout the period \nof early terrestrial life was that much of the world\u2019s landscape was dominated by giant tree \nferns and vast swamps, which by their boggy nature disrupted the normal carbon recycling \nprocess. Instead of completely rotting down, falling fronds and other dead vegetative matter \naccumulated in rich, wet sediments, which were eventually squeezed into the vast coal beds \nthat sustain much economic activity even now. \n    The heady levels of oxygen clearly encouraged outsized growth. The oldest indication of a \nsurface animal yet found is a track left 350 million years ago by a millipede-like creature on arock in Scotland. It was over three feet long. Before the era was out some millipedes would \nreach lengths more than double that. \n    With such creatures on the prowl, it is perhaps not surprising that insects in the period \nevolved a trick that could keep them safely out of tongue shot: they learned to fly. Some took \nto this new means of locomotion with such uncanny facility that they haven\u2019t changed their \ntechniques in all the time since. Then, as now, dragonflies could cruise at up to thirty-five \nmiles an hour, instantly stop, hover, fly backwards, and lift far more proportionately than any \nhuman flying machine. \u201cThe U.S. Air Force,\u201d one commentator has written, \u201chas put them in \nwind tunnels to see how they do it, and despaired.\u201d They, too, gorged on the rich air. In \nCarboniferous forests dragonflies grew as big as ravens. Trees and other vegetation likewise \nattained outsized proportions. Horsetails and tree ferns grew to heights of fifty feet, club \nmosses to a hundred and thirty. \n    The first terrestrial vertebrates\u2014which is to say, the first land animals from which we \nwould derive\u2014are something of a mystery. This is partly because of a shortage of relevant \nfossils, but partly also because of an idiosyncratic Swede named Erik Jarvik whose odd \ninterpretations and secretive manner held back progress on this question for almost half a \ncentury. Jarvik was part of a team of Scandinavian scholars who went to Greenland in the \n1930s and 1940s looking for fossil fish. In particular they sought lobe-finned fish of the type \nthat presumably were ancestral to us and all other walking creatures, known as tetrapods. \n    Most animals are tetrapods, and all living tetrapods have one thing in common: four limbs \nthat end in a maximum of five fingers or toes. Dinosaurs, whales, birds, humans, even fish\u2014\nall are tetrapods, which clearly suggests they come from a single common ancestor. The clue \nto this ancestor, it was assumed, would be found in the Devonian era, from about 400 million \nyears ago. Before that time nothing walked on land. After that time lots of things did. Luckily \nthe team found just such a creature, a three-foot-long animal called an Ichthyostega. The \nanalysis of the fossil fell to Jarvik, who began his study in 1948 and kept at it for the next \nforty-eight years. Unfortunately, Jarvik refused to let anyone study his tetrapod. The world\u2019s \npaleontologists had to be content with two sketchy interim papers in which Jarvik noted that \nthe creature had five fingers in each of four limbs, confirming its ancestral importance. \n    Jarvik died in 1998. After his death, other paleontologists eagerly examined the specimen \nand found that Jarvik had severely miscounted the fingers and toes\u2014there were actually eight \non each limb\u2014and failed to observe that the fish could not possibly have walked. The \nstructure of the fin was such that it would have collapsed under its own weight. Needless to \nsay, this did not do a great deal to advance our understanding of the first land animals. Today \nthree early tetrapods are known and none has five digits. In short, we don\u2019t know quite where \nwe came from. \n    But come we did, though reaching our present state of eminence has not of course always \nbeen straightforward. Since life on land began, it has consisted of four megadynasties, as they \nare sometimes called. The first consisted of primitive, plodding but sometimes fairly hefty \namphibians and reptiles. The best-known animal of this age was the Dimetrodon, a sail-\nbacked creature that is commonly confused with dinosaurs (including, I note, in a picture \ncaption in the Carl Sagan book Comet). The Dimetrodon was in fact a synapsid. So, once \nupon a time, were we. Synapsids were one of the four main divisions of early reptilian life, \nthe others being anapsids, euryapsids, and diapsids. The names simply refer to the number and \nlocation of small holes to be found in the sides of their owners\u2019 skulls. Synapsids had one hole \nin their lower temples; diapsids had two; euryapsids had a single hole higher up.Over time, each of these principal groupings split into further subdivisions, of which some \nprospered and some faltered. Anapsids gave rise to the turtles, which for a time, perhaps a \ntouch improbably, appeared poised to predominate as the planet\u2019s most advanced and deadly \nspecies, before an evolutionary lurch let them settle for durability rather than dominance. The \nsynapsids divided into four streams, only one of which survived beyond the Permian. \nHappily, that was the stream we belonged to, and it evolved into a family of protomammals \nknown as therapsids. These formed Megadynasty 2. \n    Unfortunately for the therapsids, their cousins the diapsids were also productively evolving, \nin their case into dinosaurs (among other things), which gradually proved too much for the \ntherapsids. Unable to compete head to head with these aggressive new creatures, the \ntherapsids by and large vanished from the record. A very few, however, evolved into small, \nfurry, burrowing beings that bided their time for a very long while as little mammals. The \nbiggest of them grew no larger than a house cat, and most were no bigger than mice. \nEventually, this would prove their salvation, but they would have to wait nearly 150 million \nyears for Megadynasty 3, the Age of Dinosaurs, to come to an abrupt end and make room for \nMegadynasty 4 and our own Age of Mammals. \n    Each of these massive transformations, as well as many smaller ones between and since, \nwas dependent on that paradoxically important motor of progress: extinction. It is a curious \nfact that on Earth species death is, in the most literal sense, a way of life. No one knows how \nmany species of organisms have existed since life began. Thirty billion is a commonly cited \nfigure, but the number has been put as high as 4,000 billion. Whatever the actual total, 99.99 \npercent of all species that have ever lived are no longer with us. \u201cTo a first approximation,\u201d as \nDavid Raup of the University of Chicago likes to say, \u201call species are extinct.\u201d For complex \norganisms, the average lifespan of a species is only about four million years\u2014roughly about \nwhere we are now. \n    Extinction is always bad news for the victims, of course, but it appears to be a good thing \nfor a dynamic planet. \u201cThe alternative to extinction is stagnation,\u201d says Ian Tattersall of the \nAmerican Museum of Natural History, \u201cand stagnation is seldom a good thing in any realm.\u201d \n(I should perhaps note that we are speaking here of extinction as a natural, long-term process. \nExtinction brought about by human carelessness is another matter altogether.) \n  \n    Crises in Earth\u2019s history are invariably associated with dramatic leaps afterward. The fall of \nthe Ediacaran fauna was followed by the creative outburst of the Cambrian period. The \nOrdovician extinction of 440 million years ago cleared the oceans of a lot of immobile filter \nfeeders and, somehow, created conditions that favored darting fish and giant aquatic reptiles. \nThese in turn were in an ideal position to send colonists onto dry land when another blowout \nin the late Devonian period gave life another sound shaking. And so it has gone at scattered \nintervals through history. If most of these events hadn\u2019t happened just as they did, just when \nthey did, we almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be here now. \n    Earth has seen five major extinction episodes in its time\u2014the Ordovician, Devonian, \nPermian, Triassic, and Cretaceous, in that order\u2014and many smaller ones. The Ordovician \n(440 million years ago) and Devonian (365 million) each wiped out about 80 to 85 percent of \nspecies. The Triassic (210 million years ago) and Cretaceous (65 million years) each wiped \nout 70 to 75 percent of species. But the real whopper was the Permian extinction of about 245 \nmillion years ago, which raised the curtain on the long age of the dinosaurs. In the Permian, atleast 95 percent of animals known from the fossil record check out, never to return. Even \nabout a third of insect species went\u2014the only occasion on which they were lost en masse. It is \nas close as we have ever come to total obliteration. \n    \u201cIt was, truly, a mass extinction, a carnage of a magnitude that had never troubled the Earth \nbefore,\u201d says Richard Fortey. The Permian event was particularly devastating to sea creatures. \nTrilobites vanished altogether. Clams and sea urchins nearly went. Virtually all other marine \norganisms were staggered. Altogether, on land and in the water, it is thought that Earth lost 52 \npercent of its families\u2014that\u2019s the level above genus and below order on the grand scale of life \n(the subject of the next chapter)\u2014and perhaps as many as 96 percent of all its species. It \nwould be a long time\u2014as much as eighty million years by one reckoning\u2014before species \ntotals recovered. \n    Two points need to be kept in mind. First, these are all just informed guesses. Estimates for \nthe number of animal species alive at the end of the Permian range from as low as 45,000 to \nas high as 240,000. If you don\u2019t know how many species were alive, you can hardly specify \nwith conviction the proportion that perished. Moreover, we are talking about the death of \nspecies, not individuals. For individuals the death toll could be much higher\u2014in many cases, \npractically total. The species that survived to the next phase of life\u2019s lottery almost certainly \nowe their existence to a few scarred and limping survivors. \n    In between the big kill-offs, there have also been many smaller, less well-known extinction \nepisodes\u2014the Hemphillian, Frasnian, Famennian, Rancholabrean, and a dozen or so others\u2014\nwhich were not so devastating to total species numbers, but often critically hit certain \npopulations. Grazing animals, including horses, were nearly wiped out in the Hemphillian \nevent about five million years ago. Horses declined to a single species, which appears so \nsporadically in the fossil record as to suggest that for a time it teetered on the brink of \noblivion. Imagine a human history without horses, without grazing animals. \n    In nearly every case, for both big extinctions and more modest ones, we have bewilderingly \nlittle idea of what the cause was. Even after stripping out the more crackpot notions there are \nstill more theories for what caused the extinction events than there have been events. At least \ntwo dozen potential culprits have been identified as causes or prime contributors: global \nwarming, global cooling, changing sea levels, oxygen depletion of the seas (a condition \nknown as anoxia), epidemics, giant leaks of methane gas from the seafloor, meteor and comet \nimpacts, runaway hurricanes of a type known as hypercanes, huge volcanic upwellings, \ncatastrophic solar flares. \n    This last is a particularly intriguing possibility. Nobody knows how big solar flares can get \nbecause we have only been watching them since the beginning of the space age, but the Sun is \na mighty engine and its storms are commensurately enormous. A typical solar flare\u2014\nsomething we wouldn\u2019t even notice on Earth\u2014will release the energy equivalent of a billion \nhydrogen bombs and fling into space a hundred billion tons or so of murderous high-energy \nparticles. The magnetosphere and atmosphere between them normally swat these back into \nspace or steer them safely toward the poles (where they produce the Earth\u2019s comely auroras), \nbut it is thought that an unusually big blast, say a hundred times the typical flare, could \noverwhelm our ethereal defenses. The light show would be a glorious one, but it would almost \ncertainly kill a very high proportion of all that basked in its glow. Moreover, and rather \nchillingly, according to Bruce Tsurutani of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, \u201cit would \nleave no trace in history.\u201dWhat all this leaves us with, as one researcher has put it, is \u201ctons of conjecture and very \nlittle evidence.\u201d Cooling seems to be associated with at least three of the big extinction \nevents\u2014the Ordovician, Devonian, and Permian\u2014but beyond that little is agreed, including \nwhether a particular episode happened swiftly or slowly. Scientists can\u2019t agree, for instance, \nwhether the late Devonian extinction\u2014the event that was followed by vertebrates moving \nonto the land\u2014happened over millions of years or thousands of years or in one lively day. \n    One of the reasons it is so hard to produce convincing explanations for extinctions is that it \nis so very hard to exterminate life on a grand scale. As we have seen from the Manson impact, \nyou can receive a ferocious blow and still stage a full, if presumably somewhat wobbly, \nrecovery. So why, out of all the thousands of impacts Earth has endured, was the KT event so \nsingularly devastating? Well, first itwas positively enormous. It struck with the force of 100 \nmillion megatons. Such an outburst is not easily imagined, but as James Lawrence Powell has \npointed out, if you exploded one Hiroshima-sized bomb for every person alive on earth today \nyou would still be about a billion bombs short of the size of the KT impact. But even that \nalone may not have been enough to wipe out 70 percent of Earth\u2019s life, dinosaurs included. \n    The KT meteor had the additional advantage\u2014advantage if you are a mammal, that is\u2014\nthat it landed in a shallow sea just ten meters deep, probably at just the right angle, at a time \nwhen oxygen levels were 10 percent higher than at present and so the world was more \ncombustible. Above all the floor of the sea where it landed was made of rock rich in sulfur. \nThe result was an impact that turned an area of seafloor the size of Belgium into aerosols of \nsulfuric acid. For months afterward, the Earth was subjected to rains acid enough to burn skin. \n    In a sense, an even greater question than that of what wiped out 70 percent of the species \nthat were existing at the time is how did the remaining 30 percent survive? Why was the event \nso irremediably devastating to every single dinosaur that existed, while other reptiles, like \nsnakes and crocodiles, passed through unimpeded? So far as we can tell no species of toad, \nnewt, salamander, or other amphibian went extinct in North America. \u201cWhy should these \ndelicate creatures have emerged unscathed from such an unparalleled disaster?\u201d asks Tim \nFlannery in his fascinating prehistory of America, Eternal Frontier. \n    In the seas it was much the same story. All the ammonites vanished, but their cousins the \nnautiloids, who lived similar lifestyles, swam on. Among plankton, some species were \npractically wiped out\u201492 percent of foraminiferans, for instance\u2014while other organisms like \ndiatoms, designed to a similar plan and living alongside, were comparatively unscathed. \n    These are difficult inconsistencies. As Richard Fortey observes: \u201cSomehow it does not \nseem satisfying just to call them \u2018lucky ones\u2019 and leave it at that.\u201d If, as seems entirely likely, \nthe event was followed by months of dark and choking smoke, then many of the insect \nsurvivors become difficult to account for. \u201cSome insects, like beetles,\u201d Fortey notes, \u201ccould \nlive on wood or other things lying around. But what about those like bees that navigate by \nsunlight and need pollen? Explaining their survival isn\u2019t so easy.\u201d \n    Above all, there are the corals. Corals require algae to survive and algae require sunlight, \nand both together require steady minimum temperatures. Much publicity has been given in the \nlast few years to corals dying from changes in sea temperature of only a degree or so. If they \nare that vulnerable to small changes, how did they survive the long impact winter? \n    There are also many hard-to-explain regional variations. Extinctions seem to have been far \nless severe in the southern hemisphere than the northern. New Zealand in particular appears tohave come through largely unscathed even though it had almost no burrowing creatures. Even \nits vegetation was overwhelmingly spared, and yet the scale of conflagration elsewhere \nsuggests that devastation was global. In short, there is just a great deal we don\u2019t know. \n    Some animals absolutely prospered\u2014including, a little surprisingly, the turtles once again. \nAs Flannery notes, the period immediately after the dinosaur extinction could well be known \nas the Age of Turtles. Sixteen species survived in North America and three more came into \nexistence soon after. \n    Clearly it helped to be at home in water. The KT impact wiped out almost 90 percent of \nland-based species but only 10 percent of those living in fresh water. Water obviously offered \nprotection against heat and flame, but also presumably provided more sustenance in the lean \nperiod that followed. All the land-based animals that survived had a habit of retreating to a \nsafer environment during times of danger\u2014into water or underground\u2014either of which \nwould have provided considerable shelter against the ravages without. Animals that \nscavenged for a living would also have enjoyed an advantage. Lizards were, and are, largely \nimpervious to the bacteria in rotting carcasses. Indeed, often they are positively drawn to it, \nand for a long while there were clearly a lot of putrid carcasses about. \n    It is often wrongly stated that only small animals survived the KT event. In fact, among the \nsurvivors were crocodiles, which were not just large but three times larger than they are today. \nBut on the whole, it is true, most of the survivors were small and furtive. Indeed, with the \nworld dark and hostile, it was a perfect time to be small, warm-blooded, nocturnal, flexible in \ndiet, and cautious by nature\u2014the very qualities that distinguished our mammalian forebears. \nHad our evolution been more advanced, we would probably have been wiped out. Instead, \nmammals found themselves in a world to which they were as well suited as anything alive. \n    However, it wasn\u2019t as if mammals swarmed forward to fill every niche. \u201cEvolution may \nabhor a vacuum,\u201d wrote the paleobiologist Steven M. Stanley, \u201cbut it often takes a long time \nto fill it.\u201d For perhaps as many as ten million years mammals remained cautiously small. In \nthe early Tertiary, if you were the size of a bobcat you could be king. \n    But once they got going, mammals expanded prodigiously\u2014sometimes to an almost \npreposterous degree. For a time, there were guinea pigs the size of rhinos and rhinos the size \nof a two-story house. Wherever there was a vacancy in the predatory chain, mammals rose \n(often literally) to fill it. Early members of the raccoon family migrated to South America, \ndiscovered a vacancy, and evolved into creatures the size and ferocity of bears. Birds, too, \nprospered disproportionately. For millions of years, a gigantic, flightless, carnivorous bird \ncalled Titanis was possibly the most ferocious creature in North America. Certainly it was the \nmost daunting bird that ever lived. It stood ten feet high, weighed over eight hundred pounds, \nand had a beak that could tear the head off pretty much anything that irked it. Its family \nsurvived in formidable fashion for fifty million years, yet until a skeleton was discovered in \nFlorida in 1963, we had no idea that it had ever existed. \n    Which brings us to another reason for our uncertainty about extinctions: the paltriness of \nthe fossil record. We have touched already on the unlikelihood of any set of bones becoming \nfossilized, but the record is actually worse than you might think. Consider dinosaurs. \nMuseums give the impression that we have a global abundance of dinosaur fossils. In fact, \noverwhelmingly museum displays are artificial. The giant Diplodocus that dominates the \nentrance hall of the Natural History Museum in London and has delighted and informed \ngenerations of visitors is made of plaster\u2014built in 1903 in Pittsburgh and presented to themuseum by Andrew Carnegie. The entrance hall of the American Museum of Natural History \nin New York is dominated by an even grander tableau: a skeleton of a large Barosaurus \ndefending her baby from attack by a darting and toothy Allosaurus. It is a wonderfully \nimpressive display\u2014the Barosaurus rises perhaps thirty feet toward the high ceiling\u2014but also \nentirely fake. Every one of the several hundred bones in the display is a cast. Visit almost any \nlarge natural history museum in the world\u2014in Paris, Vienna, Frankfurt, Buenos Aires, \nMexico City\u2014and what will greet you are antique models, not ancient bones. \n    The fact is, we don\u2019t really know a great deal about the dinosaurs. For the whole of the Age \nof Dinosaurs, fewer than a thousand species have been identified (almost half of them known \nfrom a single specimen), which is about a quarter of the number of mammal species alive \nnow. Dinosaurs, bear in mind, ruled the Earth for roughly three times as long as mammals \nhave, so either dinosaurs were remarkably unproductive of species or we have barely \nscratched the surface (to use an irresistibly apt clich\u00e9). \n    For millions of years through the Age of Dinosaurs not a single fossil has yet been found. \nEven for the period of the late Cretaceous\u2014the most studied prehistoric period there is, \nthanks to our long interest in dinosaurs and their extinction\u2014some three quarters of all \nspecies that lived may yet be undiscovered. Animals bulkier than the Diplodocus or more \nforbidding than tyrannosaurus may have roamed the Earth in the thousands, and we may \nnever know it. Until very recently everything known about the dinosaurs of this period came \nfrom only about three hundred specimens representing just sixteen species. The scantiness of \nthe record led to the widespread belief that dinosaurs were on their way out already when the \nKT impact occurred. \n    In the late 1980s a paleontologist from the Milwaukee Public Museum, Peter Sheehan, \ndecided to conduct an experiment. Using two hundred volunteers, he made a painstaking \ncensus of a well-defined, but also well-picked-over, area of the famous Hell Creek formation \nin Montana. Sifting meticulously, the volunteers collected every last tooth and vertebra and \nchip of bone\u2014everything that had been overlooked by previous diggers. The work took three \nyears. When finished they found that they had more than tripled the global total of dinosaur \nfossils from the late Cretaceous. The survey established that dinosaurs remained numerous \nright up to the time of the KT impact. \u201cThere is no reason to believe that the dinosaurs were \ndying out gradually during the last three million years of the Cretaceous,\u201d Sheehan reported. \n    We are so used to the notion of our own inevitability as life\u2019s dominant species that it is \nhard to grasp that we are here only because of timely extraterrestrial bangs and other random \nflukes. The one thing we have in common with all other living things is that for nearly four \nbillion years our ancestors have managed to slip through a series of closing doors every time \nwe needed them to. Stephen Jay Gould expressed it succinctly in a well-known line: \u201cHumans \nare here today because our particular line never fractured\u2014never once at any of the billion \npoints that could have erased us from history.\u201d \n    We started this chapter with three points: Life wants to be; life doesn\u2019t always want to be \nmuch; life from time to time goes extinct. To this we may add a fourth: Life goes on. And \noften, as we shall see, it goes on in ways that are decidedly amazing.", "23": "23    THE RICHNESS OF BEING \n \n \n \n \nHERE AND THERE in the Natural History Museum in London, built into recesses along the \nunderlit corridors or standing between glass cases of minerals and ostrich eggs and a century \nor so of other productive clutter, are secret doors\u2014at least secret in the sense that there is \nnothing about them to attract the visitor\u2019s notice. Occasionally you might see someone with \nthe distracted manner and interestingly willful hair that mark the scholar emerge from one of \nthe doors and hasten down a corridor, probably to disappear through another door a little \nfurther on, but this is a relatively rare event. For the most part the doors stay shut, giving no \nhint that beyond them exists another\u2014a parallel\u2014Natural History Museum as vast as, and in \nmany ways more wonderful than, the one the public knows and adores. \n    The Natural History Museum contains some seventy million objects from every realm of \nlife and every corner of the planet, with another hundred thousand or so added to the \ncollection each year, but it is really only behind the scenes that you get a sense of what a \ntreasure house this is. In cupboards and cabinets and long rooms full of close-packed shelves \nare kept tens of thousands of pickled animals in bottles, millions of insects pinned to squares \nof card, drawers of shiny mollusks, bones of dinosaurs, skulls of early humans, endless \nfolders of neatly pressed plants. It is a little like wandering through Darwin\u2019s brain. The spirit \nroom alone holds fifteen miles of shelving containing jar upon jar of animals preserved in \nmethylated spirit. \n    Back here are specimens collected by Joseph Banks in Australia, Alexander von Humboldt \nin Amazonia, Darwin on the Beagle voyage, and much else that is either very rare or \nhistorically important or both. Many people would love to get their hands on these things. A \nfew actually have. In 1954 the museum acquired an outstanding ornithological collection from \nthe estate of a devoted collector named Richard Meinertzhagen, author of Birds of Arabia, \namong other scholarly works. Meinertzhagen had been a faithful attendee of the museum for \nyears, coming almost daily to take notes for the production of his books and monographs. \nWhen the crates arrived, the curators excitedly jimmied them open to see what they had been \nleft and were surprised, to put it mildly, to discover that a very large number of specimens \nbore the museum\u2019s own labels. Mr. Meinertzhagen, it turned out, had been helping himself to \ntheir collections for years. It also explained his habit of wearing a large overcoat even during \nwarm weather. \n   A few years later a charming old regular in the mollusks department\u2014\u201cquite a distinguished \ngentleman,\u201d I was told\u2014was caught inserting valued seashells into the hollow legs of his \nZimmer frame. \n    \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s anything in here that somebody somewhere doesn\u2019t covet,\u201d \nRichard Fortey said with a thoughtful air as he gave me a tour of the beguiling world that is \nthe behind-the-scenes part of the museum. We wandered through a confusion of departments \nwhere people sat at large tables doing intent, investigative things with arthropods and palmfronds and boxes of yellowed bones. Everywhere there was an air of unhurried thoroughness, \nof people being engaged in a gigantic endeavor that could never be completed and mustn\u2019t be \nrushed. In 1967, I had read, the museum issued its report on the John Murray Expedition, an \nIndian Ocean survey, forty-four years after the expedition had concluded. This is a world \nwhere things move at their own pace, including a tiny lift Fortey and I shared with a scholarly \nlooking elderly man with whom Fortey chatted genially and familiarly as we proceeded \nupwards at about the rate that sediments are laid down. \n    When the man departed, Fortey said to me: \u201cThat was a very nice chap named Norman \nwho\u2019s spent forty-two years studying one species of plant, St. John\u2019s wort. He retired in 1989, \nbut he still comes in every week.\u201d \n    \u201cHow do you spend forty-two years on one species of plant?\u201d I asked. \n    \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Fortey agreed. He thought for a moment. \u201cHe\u2019s very thorough \napparently.\u201d The lift door opened to reveal a bricked-over opening. Fortey looked \nconfounded. \u201cThat\u2019s very strange,\u201d he said. \u201cThat used to be Botany back there.\u201d He punched \na button for another floor, and we found our way at length to Botany by means of back \nstaircases and discreet trespass through yet more departments where investigators toiled \nlovingly over once-living objects. And so it was that I was introduced to Len Ellis and the \nquiet world of bryophytes\u2014mosses to the rest of us. \n  \n    When Emerson poetically noted that mosses favor the north sides of trees (\u201cThe moss upon \nthe forest bark, was pole-star when the night was dark\u201d) he really meant lichens, for in the \nnineteenth century mosses and lichens weren\u2019t distinguished. True mosses aren\u2019t actually \nfussy about where they grow, so they are no good as natural compasses. In fact, mosses aren\u2019t \nactually much good for anything. \u201cPerhaps no great group of plants has so few uses, \ncommercial or economic, as the mosses,\u201d wrote Henry S. Conard, perhaps just a touch sadly, \nin How to Know the Mosses and Liverworts, published in 1956 and still to be found on many \nlibrary shelves as almost the only attempt to popularize the subject. \n    They are, however, prolific. Even with lichens removed, bryophytes is a busy realm, with \nover ten thousand species contained within some seven hundred genera. The plump and \nstately Moss Flora of Britain and Ireland by A. J. E. Smith runs to seven hundred pages, and \nBritain and Ireland are by no means outstandingly mossy places. \u201cThe tropics are where you \nfind the variety,\u201d Len Ellis told me. A quiet, spare man, he has been at the Natural History \nMuseum for twenty-seven years and curator of the department since 1990. \u201cYou can go out \ninto a place like the rain forests of Malaysia and find new varieties with relative ease. I did \nthat myself not long ago. I looked down and there was a species that had never been \nrecorded.\u201d \n    \u201cSo we don\u2019t know how many species are still to be discovered?\u201d \n    \u201cOh, no. No idea.\u201d \n    You might not think there would be that many people in the world prepared to devote \nlifetimes to the study of something so inescapably low key, but in fact moss people number in \nthe hundreds and they feel very strongly about their subject. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d Ellis told me, \u201cthe \nmeetings can get very lively at times.\u201dI asked him for an example of controversy. \n    \u201cWell, here\u2019s one inflicted on us by one of your countrymen,\u201d he said, smiling lightly, and \nopened a hefty reference work containing illustrations of mosses whose most notable \ncharacteristic to the uninstructed eye was their uncanny similarity one to another. \u201cThat,\u201d he \nsaid, tapping a moss, \u201cused to be one genus, Drepanocladus. Now it\u2019s been reorganized into \nthree: Drepanocladus, Wamstorfia, and Hamatacoulis.\u201d \n    \u201cAnd did that lead to blows?\u201d I asked perhaps a touch hopefully. \n    \u201cWell, it made sense. It made perfect sense. But it meant a lot of reordering of collections \nand it put all the books out of date for a time, so there was a bit of, you know, grumbling.\u201d \n    Mosses offer mysteries as well, he told me. One famous case\u2014famous to moss people \nanyway\u2014involved a retiring type called Hyophila stanfordensis, which was discovered on the \ncampus of Stanford University in California and later also found growing beside a path in \nCornwall, on the southwest tip of England, but has never been encountered anywhere in \nbetween. How it came to exist in two such unconnected locations is anybody\u2019s guess. \u201cIt\u2019s \nnow known as Hennediella stanfordensis,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cAnother revision.\u201d \n    We nodded thoughtfully. \n    When a new moss is found it must be compared with all other mosses to make sure that it \nhasn\u2019t been recorded already. Then a formal description must be written and illustrations \nprepared and the result published in a respectable journal. The whole process seldom takes \nless than six months. The twentieth century was not a great age for moss taxonomy. Much of \nthe century\u2019s work was devoted to untangling the confusions and duplications left behind by \nthe nineteenth century. \n    That was the golden age of moss collecting. (You may recall that Charles Lyell\u2019s father \nwas a great moss man.) One aptly named Englishman, George Hunt, hunted British mosses so \nassiduously that he probably contributed to the extinction of several species. But it is thanks \nto such efforts that Len Ellis\u2019s collection is one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive. All \n780,000 of his specimens are pressed into large folded sheets of heavy paper, some very old \nand covered with spidery Victorian script. Some, for all we knew, might have been in the \nhand of Robert Brown, the great Victorian botanist, unveiler of Brownian motion and the \nnucleus of cells, who founded and ran the museum\u2019s botany department for its first thirty-one \nyears until his death in 1858. All the specimens are kept in lustrous old mahogany cabinets so \nstrikingly fine that I remarked upon them. \n    \u201cOh, those were Sir Joseph Banks\u2019s, from his house in Soho Square,\u201d Ellis said casually, as \nif identifying a recent purchase from Ikea. \u201cHe had them built to hold his specimens from the \nEndeavour voyage.\u201d He regarded the cabinets thoughtfully, as if for the first time in a long \nwhile. \u201cI don\u2019t know howwe ended up with them in bryology,\u201d he added. \n    This was an amazing disclosure. Joseph Banks was England\u2019s greatest botanist, and the \nEndeavour voyage\u2014that is the one on which Captain Cook charted the 1769 transit of Venus \nand claimed Australia for the crown, among rather a lot else\u2014was the greatest botanical \nexpedition in history. Banks paid \u00a310,000, about $1 million in today\u2019s money, to bring \nhimself and a party of nine others\u2014a naturalist, a secretary, three artists, and four servants\u2014\non the three-year adventure around the world. Goodness knows what the bluff Captain Cookmade of such a velvety and pampered assemblage, but he seems to have liked Banks well \nenough and could not but admire his talents in botany\u2014a feeling shared by posterity. \n    Never before or since has a botanical party enjoyed greater triumphs. Partly it was because \nthe voyage took in so many new or little-known places\u2014Tierra del Fuego, Tahiti, New \nZealand, Australia, New Guinea\u2014but mostly it was because Banks was such an astute and \ninventive collector. Even when unable to go ashore at Rio de Janeiro because of a quarantine, \nhe sifted through a bale of fodder sent for the ship\u2019s livestock and made new discoveries. \nNothing, it seems, escaped his notice. Altogether he brought back thirty thousand plant \nspecimens, including fourteen hundred not seen before\u2014enough to increase by about a \nquarter the number of known plants in the world. \n    But Banks\u2019s grand cache was only part of the total haul in what was an almost absurdly \nacquisitive age. Plant collecting in the eighteenth century became a kind of international \nmania. Glory and wealth alike awaited those who could find new species, and botanists and \nadventurers went to the most incredible lengths to satisfy the world\u2019s craving for horticultural \nnovelty. Thomas Nuttall, the man who named the wisteria after Caspar Wistar, came to \nAmerica as an uneducated printer but discovered a passion for plants and walked halfway \nacross the country and back again, collecting hundreds of growing things never seen before. \nJohn Fraser, for whom is named the Fraser fir, spent years in the wilderness collecting on \nbehalf of Catherine the Great and emerged at length to find that Russia had a new czar who \nthought he was mad and refused to honor his contract. Fraser took everything to Chelsea, \nwhere he opened a nursery and made a handsome living selling rhododendrons, azaleas, \nmagnolias, Virginia creepers, asters, and other colonial exotica to a delighted English gentry. \n    Huge sums could be made with the right finds. John Lyon, an amateur botanist, spent two \nhard and dangerous years collecting specimens, but cleared almost $200,000 in today\u2019s \nmoney for his efforts. Many, however, just did it for the love of botany. Nuttall gave most of \nwhat he found to the Liverpool Botanic Gardens. Eventually he became director of Harvard\u2019s \nBotanic Garden and author of the encyclopedicGenera of North American Plants (which he \nnot only wrote but also largely typeset). \n    And that was just plants. There was also all the fauna of the new worlds\u2014kangaroos, kiwis, \nraccoons, bobcats, mosquitoes, and other curious forms beyond imagining. The volume of life \non Earth was seemingly infinite, as Jonathan Swift noted in some famous lines: \n \n    So, naturalists observe, a flea \n    Hath smaller fleas that on him prey; \n    And these have smaller still to bite \u2019em; \n    And so proceed ad infinitum. \n \n    All this new information needed to be filed, ordered, and compared with what was known. \nThe world was desperate for a workable system of classification. Fortunately there was a man \nin Sweden who stood ready to provide it. \n    His name was Carl Linn\u00e9 (later changed, with permission, to the more aristocraticvon \nLinn\u00e9), but he is remembered now by the Latinized form Carolus Linnaeus. He was born in \n1707 in the village of R\u00e5shult in southern Sweden, the son of a poor but ambitious Lutheran \ncurate, and was such a sluggish student that his exasperated father apprenticed him (or, bysome accounts, nearly apprenticed him) to a cobbler. Appalled at the prospect of spending a \nlifetime banging tacks into leather, young Linn\u00e9 begged for another chance, which was \ngranted, and he never thereafter wavered from academic distinction. He studied medicine in \nSweden and Holland, though his passion became the natural world. In the early 1730s, still in \nhis twenties, he began to produce catalogues of the world\u2019s plant and animal species, using a \nsystem of his own devising, and gradually his fame grew. \n    Rarely has a man been more comfortable with his own greatness. He spent much of his \nleisure time penning long and flattering portraits of himself, declaring that there had never \n\u201cbeen a greater botanist or zoologist,\u201d and that his system of classification was \u201cthe greatest \nachievement in the realm of science.\u201d Modestly he suggested that his gravestone should bear \nthe inscription Princeps Botanicorum, \u201cPrince of Botanists.\u201d It was never wise to question his \ngenerous self-assessments. Those who did so were apt to find they had weeds named after \nthem. \n    Linnaeus\u2019s other striking quality was an abiding\u2014at times, one might say, a feverish\u2014\npreoccupation with sex. He was particularly struck by the similarity between certain bivalves \nand the female pudenda. To the parts of one species of clam he gave the names vulva, labia, \npubes, anus, and hymen. He grouped plants by the nature of their reproductive organs and \nendowed them with an arrestingly anthropomorphic amorousness. His descriptions of flowers \nand their behavior are full of references to \u201cpromiscuous intercourse,\u201d \u201cbarren concubines,\u201d \nand \u201cthe bridal bed.\u201d In spring, he wrote in one oft-quoted passage: \n \n     \nLove comes even to the plants. Males and females . . . hold their nuptials . . . \nshowing by their sexual organs which are males, which females. The flowers\u2019 \nleaves serve as a bridal bed, which the Creator has so gloriously arranged, adorned \nwith such noble bed curtains, and perfumed with so many soft scents that the \nbridegroom with his bride might there celebrate their nuptials with so much the \ngreater solemnity. When the bed has thus been made ready, then is the time for the \nbridegroom to embrace his beloved bride and surrender himself to her. \n \n    He named one genus of plants Clitoria. Not surprisingly, many people thought him strange. \nBut his system of classification was irresistible. Before Linnaeus, plants were given names \nthat were expansively descriptive. The common ground cherry was called Physalis amno \nramosissime ramis angulosis glabris foliis dentoserratis. Linnaeus lopped it back to Physalis \nangulata, which name it still uses. The plant world was equally disordered by inconsistencies \nof naming. A botanist could not be sure ifRosa sylvestris alba cum rubore, folio glabro was \nthe same plant that others called Rosa sylvestris inodora seu canina. Linnaeus solved the \npuzzlement by calling it simply Rosa canina. To make these excisions useful and agreeable to \nall required much more than simply being decisive. It required an instinct\u2014a genius, in fact\u2014\nfor spotting the salient qualities of a species. \n    The Linnaean system is so well established that we can hardly imagine an alternative, but \nbefore Linnaeus, systems of classification were often highly whimsical. Animals might be \ncategorized by whether they were wild or domesticated, terrestrial or aquatic, large or small, \neven whether they were thought handsome and noble or of no consequence. Buffon arranged \nhis animals by their utility to man. Anatomical considerations barely came into it. Linnaeusmade it his life\u2019s work to rectify this deficiency by classifying all that was alive according to \nits physical attributes. Taxonomy\u2014which is to say the science of classification\u2014has never \nlooked back. \n    It all took time, of course. The first edition of his great Systema Naturae in 1735 was just \nfourteen pages long. But it grew and grew until by the twelfth edition\u2014the last that Linnaeus \nwould live to see\u2014it extended to three volumes and 2,300 pages. In the end he named or \nrecorded some 13,000 species of plant and animal. Other works were more comprehensive\u2014\nJohn Ray\u2019s three-volume Historia Generalis Plantarum in England, completed a generation \nearlier, covered no fewer than 18,625 species of plants alone\u2014but what Linnaeus had that no \none else could touch were consistency, order, simplicity, and timeliness. Though his work \ndates from the 1730s, it didn\u2019t become widely known in England until the 1760s, just in time \nto make Linnaeus a kind of father figure to British naturalists. Nowhere was his system \nembraced with greater enthusiasm (which is why, for one thing, the Linnaean Society has its \nhome in London and not Stockholm). \n    Linnaeus was not flawless. He made room for mythical beasts and \u201cmonstrous humans\u201d \nwhose descriptions he gullibly accepted from seamen and other imaginative travelers. Among \nthese were a wild man, Homo ferus, who walked on all fours and had not yet mastered the art \nof speech, and Homo caudatus, \u201cman with a tail.\u201d But then it was, as we should not forget, an \naltogether more credulous age. Even the great Joseph Banks took a keen and believing interest \nin a series of reported sightings of mermaids off the Scottish coast at the end of the eighteenth \ncentury. For the most part, however, Linnaeus\u2019s lapses were offset by sound and often \nbrilliant taxonomy. Among other accomplishments, he saw that whales belonged with cows, \nmice, and other common terrestrial animals in the order Quadrupedia (later changed to \nMammalia), which no one had done before. \n    In the beginning, Linnaeus intended only to give each plant a genus name and a number\u2014\nConvolvulus 1, Convolvulus 2,and so on\u2014but soon realized that that was unsatisfactory and \nhit on the binomial arrangement that remains at the heart of the system to this day. The \nintention originally was to use the binomial system for everything\u2014rocks, minerals, diseases, \nwinds, whatever existed in nature. Not everyone embraced the system warmly. Many were \ndisturbed by its tendency toward indelicacy, which was slightly ironic as before Linnaeus the \ncommon names of many plants and animals had been heartily vulgar. The dandelion was long \npopularly known as the \u201cpissabed\u201d because of its supposed diuretic properties, and other \nnames in everyday use included mare\u2019s fart, naked ladies, twitch-ballock, hound\u2019s piss, open \narse, and bum-towel. One or two of these earthy appellations may unwittingly survive in \nEnglish yet. The \u201cmaidenhair\u201d in maidenhair moss, for instance, does not refer to the hair on \nthe maiden\u2019s head. At all events, it had long been felt that the natural sciences would be \nappreciably dignified by a dose of classical renaming, so there was a certain dismay in \ndiscovering that the self-appointed Prince of Botany had sprinkled his texts with such \ndesignations asClitoria, Fornicata, andVulva. \n    Over the years many of these were quietly dropped (though not all: the common slipper \nlimpet still answers on formal occasions to Crepidula fornicata) and many other refinements \nintroduced as the needs of the natural sciences grew more specialized. In particular the system \nwas bolstered by the gradual introduction of additional hierarchies.Genus (pluralgenera) and \nspecies had been employed by naturalists for over a hundred years before Linnaeus, and \norder, class, and family in their biological senses all came into use in the 1750s and 1760s. \nBut phylum wasn\u2019t coined until 1876 (by the German Ernst Haeckel), and family and orderwere treated as interchangeable until early in the twentieth century. For a time zoologists used \nfamily where botanists placed order, to the occasional confusion of nearly everyone.1  \n    Linnaeus had divided the animal world into six categories: mammals, reptiles, birds, fishes, \ninsects, and \u201cvermes,\u201d or worms, for everything that didn\u2019t fit into the first five. From the \noutset it was evident that putting lobsters and shrimp into the same category as worms was \nunsatisfactory, and various new categories such as Mollusca and Crustacea were created. \nUnfortunately these new classifications were not uniformly applied from nation to nation. In \nan attempt to reestablish order, the British in 1842 proclaimed a new set of rules called the \nStricklandian Code, but the French saw this as highhanded, and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Zoologique \ncountered with its own conflicting code. Meanwhile, the American Ornithological Society, for \nobscure reasons, decided to use the 1758 edition of Systema Naturae as the basis for all its \nnaming, rather than the 1766 edition used elsewhere, which meant that many American birds \nspent the nineteenth century logged in different genera from their avian cousins in Europe. \nNot until 1902, at an early meeting of the International Congress of Zoology, did naturalists \nbegin at last to show a spirit of compromise and adopt a universal code. \n  \n    Taxonomy is described sometimes as a science and sometimes as an art, but really it\u2019s a \nbattleground. Even today there is more disorder in the system than most people realize. Take \nthe category of the phylum, the division that describes the basic body plans of all organisms. \nA few phyla are generally well known, such as mollusks (the home of clams and snails), \narthropods (insects and crustaceans), and chordates (us and all other animals with a backbone \nor protobackbone), though things then move swiftly in the direction of obscurity. Among the \nlatter we might list Gnathostomulida (marine worms), Cnidaria (jellyfish, medusae, \nanemones, and corals), and the delicate Priapulida (or little \u201cpenis worms\u201d). Familiar or not, \nthese are elemental divisions. Yet there is surprisingly little agreement on how many phyla \nthere are or ought to be. Most biologists fix the total at about thirty, but some opt for a number \nin the low twenties, while Edward O. Wilson in The Diversity of Life puts the number at a \nsurprisingly robust eighty-nine. It depends on where you decide to make your divisions\u2014\nwhether you are a \u201clumper\u201d or a \u201csplitter,\u201d as they say in the biological world. \n    At the more workaday level of species, the possibilities for disagreements are even greater. \nWhether a species of grass should be called Aegilops incurva, Aegilops incurvata, or Aegilops \novata may not be a matter that would stir many nonbotanists to passion, but it can be a source \nof very lively heat in the right quarters. The problem is that there are five thousand species of \ngrass and many of them look awfully alike even to people who know grass. In consequence, \nsome species have been found and named at least twenty times, and there are hardly any, it \nappears, that haven\u2019t been independently identified at least twice. The two-volume Manual of \nthe Grasses of the United States devotes two hundred closely typeset pages to sorting out all \nthe synonymies, as the biological world refers to its inadvertent but quite common \nduplications. And that is just for the grasses of a single country. \n    To deal with disagreements on the global stage, a body known as the International \nAssociation for Plant Taxonomy arbitrates on questions of priority and duplication. At \n                                                 \n1 To illustrate, humans are in the domain eucarya, in the kingdom animalia, in the phylum chordata, in the \nsubphylum vertebrata, in the class mammalia, in the order primates, in the family hominidae, in the genus homo, \nin the species sapiens. (The convention, I'm informed, is to italicize genus and species names, but not those of \nhigher divisions.) Some taxonomists employ further subdivisions: tribe, suborder, infraorder, parvorder, and \nmore.intervals it hands down decrees, declaring that Zauschneria californica (a common plant in \nrock gardens) is to be known henceforth as Epilobium canum or that Aglaothamnion \ntenuissimum may now be regarded as conspecific with Aglaothamnion byssoides, but not \nwithAglaothamnion pseudobyssoides. Normally these are small matters of tidying up that \nattract little notice, but when they touch on beloved garden plants, as they sometimes do, \nshrieks of outrage inevitably follow. In the late 1980s the common chrysanthemum was \nbanished (on apparently sound scientific principles) from the genus of the same name and \nrelegated to the comparatively drab and undesirable world of the genus Dendranthema. \n    Chrysanthemum breeders are a proud and numerous lot, and they protested to the real if \nimprobable-sounding Committee on Spermatophyta. (There are also committees for \nPteridophyta, Bryophyta, and Fungi, among others, all reporting to an executive called the \nRapporteur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral; this is truly an institution to cherish.) Although the rules of nomenclature \nare supposed to be rigidly applied, botanists are not indifferent to sentiment, and in 1995 the \ndecision was reversed. Similar adjudications have saved petunias, euonymus, and a popular \nspecies of amaryllis from demotion, but not many species of geraniums, which some years \nago were transferred, amid howls, to the genus Pelargonium. The disputes are entertainingly \nsurveyed in Charles Elliott\u2019s The Potting-Shed Papers. \n    Disputes and reorderings of much the same type can be found in all the other realms of the \nliving, so keeping an overall tally is not nearly as straightforward a matter as you might \nsuppose. In consequence, the rather amazing fact is that we don\u2019t have the faintest idea\u2014\u201cnot \neven to the nearest order of magnitude,\u201d in the words of Edward O. Wilson\u2014of the number of \nthings that live on our planet. Estimates range from 3 million to 200 million. More \nextraordinary still, according to a report in the Economist, as much as 97 percent of the \nworld\u2019s plant and animal species may still await discovery. \n    Of the organisms that we do know about, more than 99 in 100 are only sketchily \ndescribed\u2014\u201ca scientific name, a handful of specimens in a museum, and a few scraps of \ndescription in scientific journals\u201d is how Wilson describes the state of our knowledge. In The \nDiversity of Life, he estimated the number of known species of all types\u2014plants, insects, \nmicrobes, algae, everything\u2014at 1.4 million, but added that that was just a guess. Other \nauthorities have put the number of known species slightly higher, at around 1.5 million to 1.8 \nmillion, but there is no central registry of these things, so nowhere to check numbers. In short, \nthe remarkable position we find ourselves in is that we don\u2019t actually know what we actually \nknow. \n    In principle you ought to be able to go to experts in each area of specialization, ask how \nmany species there are in their fields, then add the totals. Many people have in fact done so. \nThe problem is that seldom do any two come up with matching figures. Some sources put the \nnumber of known types of fungi at 70,000, others at 100,000\u2014nearly half as many again. You \ncan find confident assertions that the number of described earthworm species is 4,000 and \nequally confident assertions that the figure is 12,000. For insects, the numbers run from \n750,000 to 950,000 species. These are, you understand, supposedly the known number of \nspecies. For plants, the commonly accepted numbers range from 248,000 to 265,000. That \nmay not seem too vast a discrepancy, but it\u2019s more than twenty times the number of flowering \nplants in the whole of North America. \n    Putting things in order is not the easiest of tasks. In the early 1960s, Colin Groves of the \nAustralian National University began a systematic survey of the 250-plus known species of \nprimate. Oftentimes it turned out that the same species had been described more than once\u2014sometimes several times\u2014without any of the discoverers realizing that they were dealing with \nan animal that was already known to science. It took Groves four decades to untangle \neverything, and that was with a comparatively small group of easily distinguished, generally \nnoncontroversial creatures. Goodness knows what the results would be if anyone attempted a \nsimilar exercise with the planet\u2019s estimated 20,000 types of lichens, 50,000 species of \nmollusk, or 400,000-plus beetles. \n    What is certain is that there is a great deal of life out there, though the actual quantities are \nnecessarily \nestimates \nbased \non \nextrapolations\u2014sometimes \nexceedingly \nexpansive \nextrapolations. In a well-known exercise in the 1980s, Terry Erwin of the Smithsonian \nInstitution saturated a stand of nineteen rain forest trees in Panama with an insecticide fog, \nthen collected everything that fell into his nets from the canopy. Among his haul (actually \nhauls, since he repeated the experiment seasonally to make sure he caught migrant species) \nwere 1,200 types of beetle. Based on the distribution of beetles elsewhere, the number of \nother tree species in the forest, the number of forests in the world, the number of other insect \ntypes, and so on up a long chain of variables, he estimated a figure of 30 million species of \ninsects for the entire planet\u2014a figure he later said was too conservative. Others using the \nsame or similar data have come up with figures of 13 million, 80 million, or 100 million \ninsect types, underlining the conclusion that however carefully arrived at, such figures \ninevitably owe at least as much to supposition as to science. \n  \n    According to the Wall Street Journal, the world has \u201cabout 10,000 active taxonomists\u201d\u2014\nnot a great number when you consider how much there is to be recorded. But, the Journal \nadds, because of the cost (about $2,000 per species) and paperwork, only about fifteen \nthousand new species of all types are logged per year. \n    \u201cIt\u2019s not a biodiversity crisis, it\u2019s a taxonomist crisis!\u201d barks Koen Maes, Belgian-born \nhead of invertebrates at the Kenyan National Museum in Nairobi, whom I met briefly on a \nvisit to the country in the autumn of 2002. There were no specialized taxonomists in the \nwhole of Africa, he told me. \u201cThere was one in the Ivory Coast, but I think he has retired,\u201d he \nsaid. It takes eight to ten years to train a taxonomist, but none are coming along in Africa. \n\u201cThey are the real fossils,\u201d Maes added. He himself was to be let go at the end of the year, he \nsaid. After seven years in Kenya, his contract was not being renewed. \u201cNo funds,\u201d Maes \nexplained. \n    Writing in the journal Nature last year, the British biologist G. H. Godfray noted that there \nis a chronic \u201clack of prestige and resources\u201d for taxonomists everywhere. In consequence, \n\u201cmany species are being described poorly in isolated publications, with no attempt to relate a \nnew taxon2to existing species and classifications.\u201d Moreover, much of taxonomists\u2019 time is \ntaken up not with describing new species but simply with sorting out old ones. Many, \naccording to Godfray, \u201cspend most of their career trying to interpret the work of nineteenth-\ncentury systematicists: deconstructing their often inadequate published descriptions or \nscouring the world\u2019s museums for type material that is often in very poor condition.\u201d Godfray \nparticularly stresses the absence of attention being paid to the systematizing possibilities of \nthe Internet. The fact is that taxonomy by and large is still quaintly wedded to paper. \n                                                 \n2 The formal word for a zoological category, such as phylum or genus. The plural is taxa.In an attempt to haul things into the modern age, in 2001 Kevin Kelly, cofounder of Wired \nmagazine, launched an enterprise called the All Species Foundation with the aim of finding \nevery living organism and recording it on a database. The cost of such an exercise has been \nestimated at anywhere from $2 billion to as much as $50 billion. As of the spring of 2002, the \nfoundation had just $1.2 million in funds and four full-time employees. If, as the numbers \nsuggest, we have perhaps 100 million species of insects yet to find, and if our rates of \ndiscovery continue at the present pace, we should have a definitive total for insects in a little \nover fifteen thousand years. The rest of the animal kingdom may take a little longer. \n    So why do we know as little as we do? There are nearly as many reasons as there are \nanimals left to count, but here are a few of the principal causes: \n    Most living things are small and easily overlooked.In practical terms, this is not always a \nbad thing. You might not slumber quite so contentedly if you were aware that your mattress is \nhome to perhaps two million microscopic mites, which come out in the wee hours to sup on \nyour sebaceous oils and feast on all those lovely, crunchy flakes of skin that you shed as you \ndoze and toss. Your pillow alone may be home to forty thousand of them. (To them your head \nis just one large oily bon-bon.) And don\u2019t think a clean pillowcase will make a difference. To \nsomething on the scale of bed mites, the weave of the tightest human fabric looks like ship\u2019s \nrigging. Indeed, if your pillow is six years old\u2014which is apparently about the average age for \na pillow\u2014it has been estimated that one-tenth of its weight will be made up of \u201csloughed \nskin, living mites, dead mites and mite dung,\u201d to quote the man who did the measuring, Dr. \nJohn Maunder of the British Medical Entomology Center. (But at least they areyour mites. \nThink of what you snuggle up with each time you climb into a motel bed.)3 These mites have \nbeen with us since time immemorial, but they weren\u2019t discovered until 1965. \n    If creatures as intimately associated with us as bed mites escaped our notice until the age of \ncolor television, it\u2019s hardly surprising that most of the rest of the small-scale world is barely \nknown to us. Go out into a woods\u2014any woods at all\u2014bend down and scoop up a handful of \nsoil, and you will be holding up to 10 billion bacteria, most of them unknown to science. Your \nsample will also contain perhaps a million plump yeasts, some 200,000 hairy little fungi \nknown as molds, perhaps 10,000 protozoans (of which the most familiar is the amoeba), and \nassorted rotifers, flatworms, roundworms, and other microscopic creatures known collectively \nas cryptozoa. A large portion of these will also be unknown. \n    The most comprehensive handbook of microorganisms, Bergey\u2019s Manual of Systematic \nBacteriology, lists about 4,000 types of bacteria. In the 1980s, a pair of Norwegian scientists, \nJostein Goks\u00f8yr and Vigdis Torsvik, collected a gram of random soil from a beech forest near \ntheir lab in Bergen and carefully analyzed its bacterial content. They found that this single \nsmall sample contained between 4,000 and 5,000 separate bacterial species, more than in the \nwhole of Bergey\u2019s Manual. They then traveled to a coastal location a few miles away, \nscooped up another gram of earth, and found that it contained 4,000 to 5,000 other species. As \nEdward O. Wilson observes: \u201cIf over 9,000 microbial types exist in two pinches of substrate \nfrom two localities in Norway, how many more await discovery in other, radically different \nhabitats?\u201d Well, according to one estimate, it could be as high as 400 million. \n \n                                                 \n3 We are actually getting worse at some matters of hygiene. Dr. Maunder believes that the move toward low-\ntemperature washing machine detergents has encouraged bugs to proliferate. As he puts it: \"If you wash lousy \nclothing at low temperatures, all you get is cleaner lice.\"We don\u2019t look in the right places. In The Diversity of Life, Wilson describes how one \nbotanist spent a few days tramping around ten hectares of jungle in Borneo and discovered a \nthousand new species of flowering plant\u2014more than are found in the whole of North \nAmerica. The plants weren\u2019t hard to find. It\u2019s just that no one had looked there before. Koen \nMaes of the Kenyan National Museum told me that he went to one cloud forest, as \nmountaintop forests are known in Kenya, and in a half hour \u201cof not particularly dedicated \nlooking\u201d found four new species of millipedes, three representing new genera, and one new \nspecies of tree. \u201cBig tree,\u201d he added, and shaped his arms as if about to dance with a very \nlarge partner. Cloud forests are found on the tops of plateaus and have sometimes been \nisolated for millions of years. \u201cThey provide the ideal climate for biology and they have \nhardly been studied,\u201d he said. \n    Overall, tropical rain forests cover only about 6 percent of Earth\u2019s surface, but harbor more \nthan half of its animal life and about two-thirds of its flowering plants, and most of this life \nremains unknown to us because too few researchers spend time in them. Not incidentally, \nmuch of this could be quite valuable. At least 99 percent of flowering plants have never been \ntested for their medicinal properties. Because they can\u2019t flee from predators, plants have had \nto contrive chemical defenses, and so are particularly enriched in intriguing compounds. Even \nnow nearly a quarter of all prescribed medicines are derived from just forty plants, with \nanother 16 percent coming from animals or microbes, so there is a serious risk with every \nhectare of forest felled of losing medically vital possibilities. Using a method called \ncombinatorial chemistry, chemists can generate forty thousand compounds at a time in labs, \nbut these products are random and not uncommonly useless, whereas any natural molecule \nwill have already passed what the Economist calls \u201cthe ultimate screening programme: over \nthree and a half billion years of evolution.\u201d \n    Looking for the unknown isn\u2019t simply a matter of traveling to remote or distant places, \nhowever. In his book Life: An Unauthorised Biography, Richard Fortey notes how one \nancient bacterium was found on the wall of a country pub \u201cwhere men had urinated for \ngenerations\u201d\u2014a discovery that would seem to involve rare amounts of luckand devotion and \npossibly some other quality not specified. \n \n    There aren\u2019t enough specialists.The stock of things to be found, examined, and recorded \nvery much outruns the supply of scientists available to do it. Take the hardy and little-known \norganisms known as bdelloid rotifers. These are microscopic animals that can survive almost \nanything. When conditions are tough, they curl up into a compact shape, switch off their \nmetabolism, and wait for better times. In this state, you can drop them into boiling water or \nfreeze them almost to absolute zero\u2014that is the level where even atoms give up\u2014and, when \nthis torment has finished and they are returned to a more pleasing environment, they will \nuncurl and move on as if nothing has happened. So far, about 500 species have been identified \n(though other sources say 360), but nobody has any idea, even remotely, how many there may \nbe altogether. For years almost all that was known about them was thanks to the work of a \ndevoted amateur, a London clerical worker named David Bryce who studied them in his spare \ntime. They can be found all over the world, but you could have all the bdelloid rotifer experts \nin the world to dinner and not have to borrow plates from the neighbors. \n    Even something as important and ubiquitous as fungi\u2014and fungi are both\u2014attracts \ncomparatively little notice. Fungi are everywhere and come in many forms\u2014as mushrooms, \nmolds, mildews, yeasts, and puffballs, to name but a sampling\u2014and they exist in volumesthat most of us little suspect. Gather together all the fungi found in a typical acre of meadow \nand you would have 2,500 pounds of the stuff. These are not marginal organisms. Without \nfungi there would be no potato blights, Dutch elm disease, jock itch, or athlete\u2019s foot, but also \nno yogurts or beers or cheeses. Altogether about 70,000 species of fungi have been identified, \nbut it is thought the number could be as high as 1.8 million. A lot of mycologists work in \nindustry, making cheeses and yogurts and the like, so it is hard to say how many are actively \ninvolved in research, but we can safely take it that there are more species of fungi to be found \nthan there are people to find them. \n \n    The world is a really big place.We have been gulled by the ease of air travel and other \nforms of communication into thinking that the world is not all that big, but at ground level, \nwhere researchers must work, it is actually enormous\u2014enormous enough to be full of \nsurprises. The okapi, the nearest living relative of the giraffe, is now known to exist in \nsubstantial numbers in the rain forests of Zaire\u2014the total population is estimated at perhaps \nthirty thousand\u2014yet its existence wasn\u2019t even suspected until the twentieth century. The large \nflightless New Zealand bird called the takahe had been presumed extinct for two hundred \nyears before being found living in a rugged area of the country\u2019s South Island. In 1995 a team \nof French and British scientists in Tibet, who were lost in a snowstorm in a remote valley, \ncame across a breed of horse, called the Riwoche, that had previously been known only from \nprehistoric cave drawings. The valley\u2019s inhabitants were astonished to learn that the horse was \nconsidered a rarity in the wider world. \n    Some people think even greater surprises may await us. \u201cA leading British ethno-\nbiologist,\u201d wrote the Economist in 1995, \u201cthinks a megatherium, a sort of giant ground sloth \nwhich may stand as high as a giraffe . . . may lurk in the fastnesses of the Amazon basin.\u201d \nPerhaps significantly, the ethnobiologist wasn\u2019t named; perhaps even more significantly, \nnothing more has been heard of him or his giant sloth. No one, however, can categorically say \nthat no such thing is there until every jungly glade has been investigated, and we are a long \nway from achieving that. \n    But even if we groomed thousands of fieldworkers and dispatched them to the farthest \ncorners of the world, it would not be effort enough, for wherever life can be, it is. Life\u2019s \nextraordinary fecundity is amazing, even gratifying, but also problematic. To survey it all, you \nwould have to turn over every rock, sift through the litter on every forest floor, sieve \nunimaginable quantities of sand and dirt, climb into every forest canopy, and devise much \nmore efficient ways to examine the seas. Even then you would overlook whole ecosystems. In \nthe 1980s, spelunkers entered a deep cave in Romania that had been sealed off from the \noutside world for a long but unknown period and found thirty-three species of insects and \nother small creatures\u2014spiders, centipedes, lice\u2014all blind, colorless, and new to science. \nThey were living off the microbes in the surface scum of pools, which in turn were feeding on \nhydrogen sulfide from hot springs. \n    Our instinct may be to see the impossibility of tracking everything down as frustrating, \ndispiriting, perhaps even appalling, but it can just as well be viewed as almost unbearably \nexciting. We live on a planet that has a more or less infinite capacity to surprise. What \nreasoning person could possibly want it any other way? \n    What is nearly always most arresting in any ramble through the scattered disciplines of \nmodern science is realizing how many people have been willing to devote lifetimes to themost sumptuously esoteric lines of inquiry. In one of his essays, Stephen Jay Gould notes how \na hero of his named Henry Edward Crampton spent fifty years, from 1906 to his death in \n1956, quietly studying a genus of land snails in Polynesia called Partula. Over and over, year \nafter year, Crampton measured to the tiniest degree\u2014to eight decimal places\u2014the whorls and \narcs and gentle curves of numberless Partula, compiling the results into fastidiously detailed \ntables. A single line of text in a Crampton table could represent weeks of measurement and \ncalculation. \n    Only slightly less devoted, and certainly more unexpected, was Alfred C. Kinsey, who \nbecame famous for his studies of human sexuality in the 1940s and 1950s. But before his \nmind became filled with sex, so to speak, Kinsey was an entomologist, and a dogged one at \nthat. In one expedition lasting two years, he hiked 2,500 miles to assemble a collection of \n300,000 wasps. How many stings he collected along the way is not, alas, recorded. \n    Something that had been puzzling me was the question of how you assured a chain of \nsuccession in these arcane fields. Clearly there cannot be many institutions in the world that \nrequire or are prepared to support specialists in barnacles or Pacific snails. As we parted at the \nNatural History Museum in London, I asked Richard Fortey how science ensures that when \none person goes there\u2019s someone ready to take his place. \n    He chuckled rather heartily at my naivet\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not as if we have substitutes \nsitting on the bench somewhere waiting to be called in to play. When a specialist retires or, \neven more unfortunately, dies, that can bring a stop to things in that field, sometimes for a \nvery long while.\u201d \n    \u201cAnd I suppose that\u2019s why you value someone who spends forty-two years studying a \nsingle species of plant, even if it doesn\u2019t produce anything terribly new?\u201d \n    \u201cPrecisely,\u201d he said, \u201cprecisely.\u201d And he really seemed to mean it.", "24": "24    CELLS \n \n \n \n \nIT STARTS WITH a single cell. The first cell splits to become two and the two become four \nand so on. After just forty-seven doublings, you have ten thousand trillion \n(10,000,000,000,000,000) cells in your body and are ready to spring forth as a human being.1 \nAnd every one of those cells knows exactly what to do to preserve and nurture you from the \nmoment of conception to your last breath. \n    You have no secrets from your cells. They know far more about you than you do. Each one \ncarries a copy of the complete genetic code\u2014the instruction manual for your body\u2014so it \nknows not only how to do its job but every other job in the body. Never in your life will you \nhave to remind a cell to keep an eye on its adenosine triphosphate levels or to find a place for \nthe extra squirt of folic acid that\u2019s just unexpectedly turned up. It will do that for you, and \nmillions more things besides. \n    Every cell in nature is a thing of wonder. Even the simplest are far beyond the limits of \nhuman ingenuity. To build the most basic yeast cell, for example, you would have to \nminiaturize about the same number of components as are found in a Boeing 777 jetliner and \nfit them into a sphere just five microns across; then somehow you would have to persuade that \nsphere to reproduce. \n    But yeast cells are as nothing compared with human cells, which are not just more varied \nand complicated, but vastly more fascinating because of their complex interactions. \n    Your cells are a country of ten thousand trillion citizens, each devoted in some intensively \nspecific way to your overall well-being. There isn\u2019t a thing they don\u2019t do for you. They let \nyou feel pleasure and form thoughts. They enable you to stand and stretch and caper. When \nyou eat, they extract the nutrients, distribute the energy, and carry off the wastes\u2014all those \nthings you learned about in junior high school biology\u2014but they also remember to make you \nhungry in the first place and reward you with a feeling of well-being afterward so that you \nwon\u2019t forget to eat again. They keep your hair growing, your ears waxed, your brain quietly \npurring. They manage every corner of your being. They will jump to your defense the instant \nyou are threatened. They will unhesitatingly die for you\u2014billions of them do so daily. And \nnot once in all your years have you thanked even one of them. So let us take a moment now to \nregard them with the wonder and appreciation they deserve. \n    We understand a little of how cells do the things they do\u2014how they lay down fat or \nmanufacture insulin or engage in many of the other acts necessary to maintain a complicated \nentity like yourself\u2014but only a little. You have at least 200,000 different types of protein \n                                                 \n1 Actually, quite a lot of cells are lost in the process of development, so the number you emerge with is really \njust a guess. Depending on which source you consult the number can vary by several orders of magnitude. The \nfigure of ten thousand trillion (or quadrillion) is from Margulis and Sagan, 1986.laboring away inside you, and so far we understand what no more than about 2 percent of \nthem do. (Others put the figure at more like 50 percent; it depends, apparently, on what you \nmean by \u201cunderstand.\u201d) \n    Surprises at the cellular level turn up all the time. In nature, nitric oxide is a formidable \ntoxin and a common component of air pollution. So scientists were naturally a little surprised \nwhen, in the mid-1980s, they found it being produced in a curiously devoted manner in \nhuman cells. Its purpose was at first a mystery, but then scientists began to find it all over the \nplace\u2014controlling the flow of blood and the energy levels of cells, attacking cancers and \nother pathogens, regulating the sense of smell, even assisting in penile erections. It also \nexplained why nitroglycerine, the well-known explosive, soothes the heart pain known as \nangina. (It is converted into nitric oxide in the bloodstream, relaxing the muscle linings of \nvessels, allowing blood to flow more freely.) In barely the space of a decade this one gassy \nsubstance went from extraneous toxin to ubiquitous elixir. \n    You possess \u201csome few hundred\u201d different types of cell, according to the Belgian \nbiochemist Christian de Duve, and they vary enormously in size and shape, from nerve cells \nwhose filaments can stretch to several feet to tiny, disc-shaped red blood cells to the rod-\nshaped photocells that help to give us vision. They also come in a sumptuously wide range of \nsizes\u2014nowhere more strikingly than at the moment of conception, when a single beating \nsperm confronts an egg eighty-five thousand times bigger than it (which rather puts the notion \nof male conquest into perspective). On average, however, a human cell is about twenty \nmicrons wide\u2014that is about two hundredths of a millimeter\u2014which is too small to be seen \nbut roomy enough to hold thousands of complicated structures like mitochondria, and millions \nupon millions of molecules. In the most literal way, cells also vary in liveliness. Your skin \ncells are all dead. It\u2019s a somewhat galling notion to reflect that every inch of your surface is \ndeceased. If you are an average-sized adult you are lugging around about five pounds of dead \nskin, of which several billion tiny fragments are sloughed off each day. Run a finger along a \ndusty shelf and you are drawing a pattern very largely in old skin. \n    Most living cells seldom last more than a month or so, but there are some notable \nexceptions. Liver cells can survive for years, though the components within them may be \nrenewed every few days. Brain cells last as long as you do. You are issued a hundred billion \nor so at birth, and that is all you are ever going to get. It has been estimated that you lose five \nhundred of them an hour, so if you have any serious thinking to do there really isn\u2019t a moment \nto waste. The good news is that the individual components of your brain cells are constantly \nrenewed so that, as with the liver cells, no part of them is actually likely to be more than about \na month old. Indeed, it has been suggested that there isn\u2019t a single bit of any of us\u2014not so \nmuch as a stray molecule\u2014that was part of us nine years ago. It may not feel like it, but at the \ncellular level we are all youngsters. \n    The first person to describe a cell was Robert Hooke, whom we last encountered \nsquabbling with Isaac Newton over credit for the invention of the inverse square law. Hooke \nachieved many things in his sixty-eight years\u2014he was both an accomplished theoretician and \na dab hand at making ingenious and useful instruments\u2014but nothing he did brought him \ngreater admiration than his popular book Microphagia: or Some Physiological Descriptions of \nMiniature Bodies Made by Magnifying Glasses, produced in 1665. It revealed to an enchanted \npublic a universe of the very small that was far more diverse, crowded, and finely structured \nthan anyone had ever come close to imagining.Among the microscopic features first identified by Hooke were little chambers in plants \nthat he called \u201ccells\u201d because they reminded him of monks\u2019 cells. Hooke calculated that a \none-inch square of cork would contain 1,259,712,000 of these tiny chambers\u2014the first \nappearance of such a very large number anywhere in science. Microscopes by this time had \nbeen around for a generation or so, but what set Hooke\u2019s apart were their technical \nsupremacy. They achieved magnifications of thirty times, making them the last word in \nseventeenth-century optical technology. \n    So it came as something of a shock when just a decade later Hooke and the other members \nof London\u2019s Royal Society began to receive drawings and reports from an unlettered linen \ndraper in Holland employing magnifications of up to 275 times. The draper\u2019s name was \nAntoni van Leeuwenhoek. Though he had little formal education and no background in \nscience, he was a perceptive and dedicated observer and a technical genius. \n    To this day it is not known how he got such magnificent magnifications from simple \nhandheld devices, which were little more than modest wooden dowels with a tiny bubble of \nglass embedded in them, far more like magnifying glasses than what most of us think of as \nmicroscopes, but really not much like either. Leeuwenhoek made a new instrument for every \nexperiment he performed and was extremely secretive about his techniques, though he did \nsometimes offer tips to the British on how they might improve their resolutions.2  \n    Over a period of fifty years\u2014beginning, remarkably enough, when he was already past \nforty\u2014he made almost two hundred reports to the Royal Society, all written in Low Dutch, \nthe only tongue of which he was master. Leeuwenhoek offered no interpretations, but simply \nthe facts of what he had found, accompanied by exquisite drawings. He sent reports on almost \neverything that could be usefully examined\u2014bread mold, a bee\u2019s stinger, blood cells, teeth, \nhair, his own saliva, excrement, and semen (these last with fretful apologies for their unsavory \nnature)\u2014nearly all of which had never been seen microscopically before. \n    After he reported finding \u201canimalcules\u201d in a sample of pepper water in 1676, the members \nof the Royal Society spent a year with the best devices English technology could produce \nsearching for the \u201clittle animals\u201d before finally getting the magnification right. What \nLeeuwenhoek had found were protozoa. He calculated that there were 8,280,000 of these tiny \nbeings in a single drop of water\u2014more than the number of people in Holland. The world \nteemed with life in ways and numbers that no one had previously suspected. \n    Inspired by Leeuwenhoek\u2019s fantastic findings, others began to peer into microscopes with \nsuch keenness that they sometimes found things that weren\u2019t in fact there. One respected \nDutch observer, Nicolaus Hartsoecker, was convinced he saw \u201ctiny preformed men\u201d in sperm \ncells. He called the little beings \u201chomunculi\u201d and for some time many people believed that all \nhumans\u2014indeed, all creatures\u2014were simply vastly inflated versions of tiny but complete \nprecursor beings. Leeuwenhoek himself occasionally got carried away with his enthusiasms. \nIn one of his least successful experiments he tried to study the explosive properties of \ngunpowder by observing a small blast at close range; he nearly blinded himself in the process. \n                                                 \n2 Leeuwenhoek was close friends with another Delft notable, the artist Jan Vermeer. In the mid-1660s, Vermeer, \nwho previously had been a competent but not outstanding artist, suddenly developed the mastery of light and \nperspective for which he has been celebrated ever since. Though it has never been proved, it has long been \nsuspected that he used a camera obscura, a device for projecting images onto a flat surface through a lens. No \nsuch device was listed among Vermeer's personal effects after his death, but it happens that the executor of \nVermeer's estate was none other than Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, the most secretive lens-maker of his day.In 1683 Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria, but that was about as far as progress could get \nfor the next century and a half because of the limitations of microscope technology. Not until \n1831 would anyone first see the nucleus of a cell\u2014it was found by the Scottish botanist \nRobert Brown, that frequent but always shadowy visitor to the history of science. Brown, who \nlived from 1773 to 1858, called it nucleus from the Latin nucula, meaning little nut or kernel. \nNot until 1839, however, did anyone realize that all living matter is cellular. It was Theodor \nSchwann, a German, who had this insight, and it was not only comparatively late, as scientific \ninsights go, but not widely embraced at first. It wasn\u2019t until the 1860s, and some landmark \nwork by Louis Pasteur in France, that it was shown conclusively that life cannot arise \nspontaneously but must come from preexisting cells. The belief became known as the \u201ccell \ntheory,\u201d and it is the basis of all modern biology. \n    The cell has been compared to many things, from \u201ca complex chemical refinery\u201d (by the \nphysicist James Trefil) to \u201ca vast, teeming metropolis\u201d (the biochemist Guy Brown). A cell is \nboth of those things and neither. It is like a refinery in that it is devoted to chemical activity \non a grand scale, and like a metropolis in that it is crowded and busy and filled with \ninteractions that seem confused and random but clearly have some system to them. But it is a \nmuch more nightmarish place than any city or factory that you have ever seen. To begin with \nthere is no up or down inside the cell (gravity doesn\u2019t meaningfully apply at the cellular \nscale), and not an atom\u2019s width of space is unused. There is activity every where and a \nceaseless thrum of electrical energy. You may not feel terribly electrical, but you are. The \nfood we eat and the oxygen we breathe are combined in the cells into electricity. The reason \nwe don\u2019t give each other massive shocks or scorch the sofa when we sit is that it is all \nhappening on a tiny scale: a mere 0.1 volts traveling distances measured in nanometers. \nHowever, scale that up and it would translate as a jolt of twenty million volts per meter, about \nthe same as the charge carried by the main body of a thunderstorm. \n    Whatever their size or shape, nearly all your cells are built to fundamentally the same plan: \nthey have an outer casing or membrane, a nucleus wherein resides the necessary genetic \ninformation to keep you going, and a busy space between the two called the cytoplasm. The \nmembrane is not, as most of us imagine it, a durable, rubbery casing, something that you \nwould need a sharp pin to prick. Rather, it is made up of a type of fatty material known as a \nlipid, which has the approximate consistency \u201cof a light grade of machine oil,\u201d to quote \nSherwin B. Nuland. If that seems surprisingly insubstantial, bear in mind that at the \nmicroscopic level things behave differently. To anything on a molecular scale water becomes \na kind of heavy-duty gel, and a lipid is like iron. \n    If you could visit a cell, you wouldn\u2019t like it. Blown up to a scale at which atoms were \nabout the size of peas, a cell itself would be a sphere roughly half a mile across, and supported \nby a complex framework of girders called the cytoskeleton. Within it, millions upon millions \nof objects\u2014some the size of basketballs, others the size of cars\u2014would whiz about like \nbullets. There wouldn\u2019t be a place you could stand without being pummeled and ripped \nthousands of times every second from every direction. Even for its full-time occupants the \ninside of a cell is a hazardous place. Each strand of DNA is on average attacked or damaged \nonce every 8.4 seconds\u2014ten thousand times in a day\u2014by chemicals and other agents that \nwhack into or carelessly slice through it, and each of these wounds must be swiftly stitched up \nif the cell is not to perish. \n    The proteins are especially lively, spinning, pulsating, and flying into each other up to a \nbillion times a second. Enzymes, themselves a type of protein, dash everywhere, performing \nup to a thousand tasks a second. Like greatly speeded up worker ants, they busily build andrebuild molecules, hauling a piece off this one, adding a piece to that one. Some monitor \npassing proteins and mark with a chemical those that are irreparably damaged or flawed. Once \nso selected, the doomed proteins proceed to a structure called a proteasome, where they are \nstripped down and their components used to build new proteins. Some types of protein exist \nfor less than half an hour; others survive for weeks. But all lead existences that are \ninconceivably frenzied. As de Duve notes, \u201cThe molecular world must necessarily remain \nentirely beyond the powers of our imagination owing to the incredible speed with which \nthings happen in it.\u201d \n    But slow things down, to a speed at which the interactions can be observed, and things \ndon\u2019t seem quite so unnerving. You can see that a cell is just millions of objects\u2014lysosomes, \nendosomes, ribosomes, ligands, peroxisomes, proteins of every size and shape\u2014bumping into \nmillions of other objects and performing mundane tasks: extracting energy from nutrients, \nassembling structures, getting rid of waste, warding off intruders, sending and receiving \nmessages, making repairs. Typically a cell will contain some 20,000 different types of protein, \nand of these about 2,000 types will each be represented by at least 50,000 molecules. \u201cThis \nmeans,\u201d says Nuland, \u201cthat even if we count only those molecules present in amounts of more \nthan 50,000 each, the total is still a very minimum of 100 million protein molecules in each \ncell. Such a staggering figure gives some idea of the swarming immensity of biochemical \nactivity within us.\u201d \n    It is all an immensely demanding process. Your heart must pump 75 gallons of blood an \nhour, 1,800 gallons every day, 657,000 gallons in a year\u2014that\u2019s enough to fill four Olympic-\nsized swimming pools\u2014to keep all those cells freshly oxygenated. (And that\u2019s at rest. During \nexercise the rate can increase as much as sixfold.) The oxygen is taken up by the \nmitochondria. These are the cells\u2019 power stations, and there are about a thousand of them in a \ntypical cell, though the number varies considerably depending on what a cell does and how \nmuch energy it requires. \n    You may recall from an earlier chapter that the mitochondria are thought to have originated \nas captive bacteria and that they now live essentially as lodgers in our cells, preserving their \nown genetic instructions, dividing to their own timetable, speaking their own language. You \nmay also recall that we are at the mercy of their goodwill. Here\u2019s why. Virtually all the food \nand oxygen you take into your body are delivered, after processing, to the mitochondria, \nwhere they are converted into a molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. \n    You may not have heard of ATP, but it is what keeps you going. ATP molecules are \nessentially little battery packs that move through the cell providing energy for all the cell\u2019s \nprocesses, and you get through a lot of it. At any given moment, a typical cell in your body \nwill have about one billion ATP molecules in it, and in two minutes every one of them will \nhave been drained dry and another billion will have taken their place. Every day you produce \nand use up a volume of ATP equivalent to about half your body weight. Feel the warmth of \nyour skin. That\u2019s your ATP at work. \n    When cells are no longer needed, they die with what can only be called great dignity. They \ntake down all the struts and buttresses that hold them together and quietly devour their \ncomponent parts. The process is known as apoptosis or programmed cell death. Every day \nbillions of your cells die for your benefit and billions of others clean up the mess. Cells can \nalso die violently\u2014for instance, when infected\u2014but mostly they die because they are told to. \nIndeed, if not told to live\u2014if not given some kind of active instruction from another cell\u2014\ncells automatically kill themselves. Cells need a lot of reassurance.When, as occasionally happens, a cell fails to expire in the prescribed manner, but rather \nbegins to divide and proliferate wildly, we call the result cancer. Cancer cells are really just \nconfused cells. Cells make this mistake fairly regularly, but the body has elaborate \nmechanisms for dealing with it. It is only very rarely that the process spirals out of control. On \naverage, humans suffer one fatal malignancy for each 100 million billion cell divisions. \nCancer is bad luck in every possible sense of the term. \n    The wonder of cells is not that things occasionally go wrong, but that they manage \neverything so smoothly for decades at a stretch. They do so by constantly sending and \nmonitoring streams of messages\u2014a cacophony of messages\u2014from all around the body: \ninstructions, queries, corrections, requests for assistance, updates, notices to divide or expire. \nMost of these signals arrive by means of couriers called hormones, chemical entities such as \ninsulin, adrenaline, estrogen, and testosterone that convey information from remote outposts \nlike the thyroid and endocrine glands. Still other messages arrive by telegraph from the brain \nor from regional centers in a process called paracrine signaling. Finally, cells communicate \ndirectly with their neighbors to make sure their actions are coordinated. \n    What is perhaps most remarkable is that it is all just random frantic action, a sequence of \nendless encounters directed by nothing more than elemental rules of attraction and repulsion. \nThere is clearly no thinking presence behind any of the actions of the cells. It all just happens, \nsmoothly and repeatedly and so reliably that seldom are we even conscious of it, yet somehow \nall this produces not just order within the cell but a perfect harmony right across the organism. \nIn ways that we have barely begun to understand, trillions upon trillions of reflexive chemical \nreactions add up to a mobile, thinking, decision-making you\u2014or, come to that, a rather less \nreflective but still incredibly organized dung beetle. Every living thing, never forget, is a \nwonder of atomic engineering. \n    Indeed, some organisms that we think of as primitive enjoy a level of cellular organization \nthat makes our own look carelessly pedestrian. Disassemble the cells of a sponge (by passing \nthem through a sieve, for instance), then dump them into a solution, and they will find their \nway back together and build themselves into a sponge again. You can do this to them over \nand over, and they will doggedly reassemble because, like you and me and every other living \nthing, they have one overwhelming impulse: to continue to be. \n    And that\u2019s because of a curious, determined, barely understood molecule that is itself not \nalive and for the most part doesn\u2019t do anything at all. We call it DNA, and to begin to \nunderstand its supreme importance to science and to us we need to go back 160 years or so to \nVictorian England and to the moment when the naturalist Charles Darwin had what has been \ncalled \u201cthe single best idea that anyone has ever had\u201d\u2014and then, for reasons that take a little \nexplaining, locked it away in a drawer for the next fifteen years.", "25": "25    DARWIN\u2019S SINGULAR NOTION \n \n \n \n \nIN THE LATE summer or early autumn of 1859, Whitwell Elwin, editor of the respected \nBritish journal the Quarterly Review, was sent an advance copy of a new book by the \nnaturalist Charles Darwin. Elwin read the book with interest and agreed that it had merit, but \nfeared that the subject matter was too narrow to attract a wide audience. He urged Darwin to \nwrite a book about pigeons instead. \u201cEveryone is interested in pigeons,\u201d he observed \nhelpfully. \n    Elwin\u2019s sage advice was ignored, and On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural \nSelection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life was published in late \nNovember 1859, priced at fifteen shillings. The first edition of 1,250 copies sold out on the \nfirst day. It has never been out of print, and scarcely out of controversy, in all the time since\u2014\nnot bad going for a man whose principal other interest was earthworms and who, but for a \nsingle impetuous decision to sail around the world, would very probably have passed his life \nas an anonymous country parson known for, well, for an interest in earthworms. \n    Charles Robert Darwin was born on February 12, 1809,1 in Shrewsbury, a sedate market \ntown in the west Midlands of England. His father was a prosperous and well-regarded \nphysician. His mother, who died when Charles was only eight, was the daughter of Josiah \nWedgwood, of pottery fame. \n    Darwin enjoyed every advantage of upbringing, but continually pained his widowed father \nwith his lackluster academic performance. \u201cYou care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-\ncatching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family,\u201d his father wrote in a line \nthat nearly always appears just about here in any review of Darwin\u2019s early life. Although his \ninclination was to natural history, for his father\u2019s sake he tried to study medicine at Edinburgh \nUniversity but couldn\u2019t bear the blood and suffering. The experience of witnessing an \noperation on an understandably distressed child\u2014this was in the days before anesthetics, of \ncourse\u2014left him permanently traumatized. He tried law instead, but found that insupportably \ndull and finally managed, more or less by default, to acquire a degree in divinity from \nCambridge. \n    A life in a rural vicarage seemed to await him when from out of the blue there came a more \ntempting offer. Darwin was invited to sail on the naval survey ship HMS Beagle, essentially \nas dinner company for the captain, Robert FitzRoy, whose rank precluded his socializing with \nanyone other than a gentleman. FitzRoy, who was very odd, chose Darwin in part because he \nliked the shape of Darwin\u2019s nose. (It betokened depth of character, he believed.) Darwin was \nnot FitzRoy\u2019s first choice, but got the nod when FitzRoy\u2019s preferred companion dropped out. \nFrom a twenty-first-century perspective the two men\u2019s most striking joint feature was their \n                                                 \n1 An auspicious date in history: on the same day in Kentucky, Abraham Lincoln was born.extreme youthfulness. At the time of sailing, FitzRoy was only twenty-three, Darwin just \ntwenty-two. \n    FitzRoy\u2019s formal assignment was to chart coastal waters, but his hobby\u2014passion really\u2014\nwas to seek out evidence for a literal, biblical interpretation of creation. That Darwin was \ntrained for the ministry was central to FitzRoy\u2019s decision to have him aboard. That Darwin \nsubsequently proved to be not only liberal of view but less than wholeheartedly devoted to \nChristian fundamentals became a source of lasting friction between them. \n    Darwin\u2019s time aboard HMS Beagle, from 1831 to 1836, was obviously the formative \nexperience of his life, but also one of the most trying. He and his captain shared a small cabin, \nwhich can\u2019t have been easy as FitzRoy was subject to fits of fury followed by spells of \nsimmering resentment. He and Darwin constantly engaged in quarrels, some \u201cbordering on \ninsanity,\u201d as Darwin later recalled. Ocean voyages tended to become melancholy \nundertakings at the best of times\u2014the previous captain of the Beagle had put a bullet through \nhis brain during a moment of lonely gloom\u2014and FitzRoy came from a family well known for \na depressive instinct. His uncle, Viscount Castlereagh, had slit his throat the previous decade \nwhile serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer. (FitzRoy would himself commit suicide by the \nsame method in 1865.) Even in his calmer moods, FitzRoy proved strangely unknowable. \nDarwin was astounded to learn upon the conclusion of their voyage that almost at once \nFitzRoy married a young woman to whom he had long been betrothed. In five years in \nDarwin\u2019s company, he had not once hinted at an attachment or even mentioned her name. \n    In every other respect, however, the Beagle voyage was a triumph. Darwin experienced \nadventure enough to last a lifetime and accumulated a hoard of specimens sufficient to make \nhis reputation and keep him occupied for years. He found a magnificent trove of giant ancient \nfossils, including the finest Megatherium known to date; survived a lethal earthquake in \nChile; discovered a new species of dolphin (which he dutifully named Delphinus fitzroyi); \nconducted diligent and useful geological investigations throughout the Andes; and developed \na new and much-admired theory for the formation of coral atolls, which suggested, not \ncoincidentally, that atolls could not form in less than a million years\u2014the first hint of his \nlong-standing attachment to the extreme antiquity of earthly processes. In 1836, aged twenty-\nseven, he returned home after being away for five years and two days. He never left England \nagain. \n     One thing Darwin didn\u2019t do on the voyage was propound the theory (or even a theory) of \nevolution. For a start, evolution as a concept was already decades old by the 1830s. Darwin\u2019s \nown grandfather, Erasmus, had paid tribute to evolutionary principles in a poem of inspired \nmediocrity called \u201cThe Temple of Nature\u201d years before Charles was even born. It wasn\u2019t until \nthe younger Darwin was back in England and read Thomas Malthus\u2019s Essay on the Principle \nof Population (which proposed that increases in food supply could never keep up with \npopulation growth for mathematical reasons) that the idea began to percolate through his mind \nthat life is a perpetual struggle and that natural selection was the means by which some \nspecies prospered while others failed. Specifically what Darwin saw was that all organisms \ncompeted for resources, and those that had some innate advantage would prosper and pass on \nthat advantage to their offspring. By such means would species continuously improve. \n    It seems an awfully simple idea\u2014it is an awfully simple idea\u2014but it explained a great deal, \nand Darwin was prepared to devote his life to it. \u201cHow stupid of me not to have thought of \nit!\u201d T. H. Huxley cried upon reading On the Origin of Species. It is a view that has been \nechoed ever since.Interestingly, Darwin didn\u2019t use the phrase \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d in any of his work \n(though he did express his admiration for it). The expression was coined five years after the \npublication of On the Origin of Species by Herbert Spencer in Principles of Biology in 1864. \nNor did he employ the word evolution in print until the sixth edition of Origin (by which time \nits use had become too widespread to resist), preferring instead \u201cdescent with modification.\u201d \nNor, above all, were his conclusions in any way inspired by his noticing, during his time in \nthe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, an interesting diversity in the beaks of finches. The story as \nconventionally told (or at least as frequently remembered by many of us) is that Darwin, \nwhile traveling from island to island, noticed that the finches\u2019 beaks on each island were \nmarvelously adapted for exploiting local resources\u2014that on one island beaks were sturdy and \nshort and good for cracking nuts, while on the next island beaks were perhaps long and thin \nand well suited for winkling food out of crevices\u2014and it was this that set him to thinking that \nperhaps the birds had not been created this way, but had in a sense created themselves. \n    In fact, the birds had created themselves, but it wasn\u2019t Darwin who noticed it. At the time \nof the Beagle voyage, Darwin was fresh out of college and not yet an accomplished naturalist \nand so failed to see that the Gal\u00e1pagos birds were all of a type. It was his friend the \nornithologist John Gould who realized that what Darwin had found was lots of finches with \ndifferent talents. Unfortunately, in his inexperience Darwin had not noted which birds came \nfrom which islands. (He had made a similar error with tortoises.) It took years to sort the \nmuddles out. \n    Because of these oversights, and the need to sort through crates and crates of other Beagle \nspecimens, it wasn\u2019t until 1842, six years after his return to England, that Darwin finally \nbegan to sketch out the rudiments of his new theory. These he expanded into a 230-page \n\u201csketch\u201d two years later. And then he did an extraordinary thing: he put his notes away and \nfor the next decade and a half busied himself with other matters. He fathered ten children, \ndevoted nearly eight years to writing an exhaustive opus on barnacles (\u201cI hate a barnacle as no \nman ever did before,\u201d he sighed, understandably, upon the work\u2019s conclusion), and fell prey \nto strange disorders that left him chronically listless, faint, and \u201cflurried,\u201d as he put it. The \nsymptoms nearly always included a terrible nausea and generally also incorporated \npalpitations, migraines, exhaustion, trembling, spots before the eyes, shortness of breath, \n\u201cswimming of the head,\u201d and, not surprisingly, depression. \n    The cause of the illness has never been established, but the most romantic and perhaps \nlikely of the many suggested possibilities is that he suffered from Chagas\u2019s disease, a \nlingering tropical malady that he could have acquired from the bite of a Benchuga bug in \nSouth America. A more prosaic explanation is that his condition was psychosomatic. In either \ncase, the misery was not. Often he could work for no more than twenty minutes at a stretch, \nsometimes not that. \n    Much of the rest of his time was devoted to a series of increasingly desperate treatments\u2014\nicy plunge baths, dousings in vinegar, draping himself with \u201celectric chains\u201d that subjected \nhim to small jolts of current. He became something of a hermit, seldom leaving his home in \nKent, Down House. One of his first acts upon moving to the house was to erect a mirror \noutside his study window so that he could identify, and if necessary avoid, callers. \n    Darwin kept his theory to himself because he well knew the storm it would cause. In 1844, \nthe year he locked his notes away, a book called Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation \nroused much of the thinking world to fury by suggesting that humans might have evolved \nfrom lesser primates without the assistance of a divine creator. Anticipating the outcry, theauthor had taken careful steps to conceal his identity, which he kept a secret from even his \nclosest friends for the next forty years. Some wondered if Darwin himself might be the author. \nOthers suspected Prince Albert. In fact, the author was a successful and generally unassuming \nScottish publisher named Robert Chambers whose reluctance to reveal himself had a practical \ndimension as well as a personal one: his firm was a leading publisher of Bibles. Vestiges was \nwarmly blasted from pulpits throughout Britain and far beyond, but also attracted a good deal \nof more scholarly ire. The Edinburgh Review devoted nearly an entire issue\u2014eighty-five \npages\u2014to pulling it to pieces. Even T. H. Huxley, a believer in evolution, attacked the book \nwith some venom, unaware that the author was a friend.2  \n    Darwin\u2019s manuscript might have remained locked away till his death but for an alarming \nblow that arrived from the Far East in the early summer of 1858 in the form of a packet \ncontaining a friendly letter from a young naturalist named Alfred Russel Wallace and the draft \nof a paper, On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type, \noutlining a theory of natural selection that was uncannily similar to Darwin\u2019s secret jottings. \nEven some of the phrasing echoed Darwin\u2019s own. \u201cI never saw a more striking coincidence,\u201d \nDarwin reflected in dismay. \u201cIf Wallace had my manuscript sketch written out in 1842, he \ncould not have made a better short abstract.\u201d \n    Wallace didn\u2019t drop into Darwin\u2019s life quite as unexpectedly as is sometimes suggested. \nThe two were already corresponding, and Wallace had more than once generously sent \nDarwin specimens that he thought might be of interest. In the process of these exchanges \nDarwin had discreetly warned Wallace that he regarded the subject of species creation as his \nown territory. \u201cThis summer will make the 20th year (!) since I opened my first note-book, on \nthe question of how & in what way do species & varieties differ from each other,\u201d he had \nwritten to Wallace some time earlier. \u201cI am now preparing my work for publication,\u201d he \nadded, even though he wasn\u2019t really. \nIn any case, Wallace failed to grasp what Darwin was trying to tell him, and of course he \ncould have no idea that his own theory was so nearly identical to one that Darwin had been \nevolving, as it were, for two decades. \nDarwin was placed in an agonizing quandary. If he rushed into print to preserve his priority, \nhe would be taking advantage of an innocent tip-off from a distant admirer. But if he stepped \naside, as gentlemanly conduct arguably required, he would lose credit for a theory that he had \nindependently propounded. Wallace\u2019s theory was, by Wallace\u2019s own admission, the result of a \nflash of insight; Darwin\u2019s was the product of years of careful, plodding, methodical thought. It \nwas all crushingly unfair. \nTo compound his misery, Darwin\u2019s youngest son, also named Charles, had contracted scarlet \nfever and was critically ill. At the height of the crisis, on June 28, the child died. Despite the \ndistraction of his son\u2019s illness, Darwin found time to dash off letters to his friends Charles \nLyell and Joseph Hooker, offering to step aside but noting that to do so would mean that all \nhis work, \u201cwhatever it may amount to, will be smashed.\u201d Lyell and Hooker came up with the \ncompromise solution of presenting a summary of Darwin\u2019s and Wallace\u2019s ideas together. The \nvenue they settled on was a meeting of the Linnaean Society, which at the time was struggling \nto find its way back into fashion as a seat of scientific eminence. On July 1, 1858, Darwin\u2019s \n                                                 \n2 Darwin was one of the few to guess correctly. He happened to be visiting Chambers one day when an advance \ncopy of the sixth edition of Vestiges was delivered. The keenness with which Chambers checked the revisions \nwas something of a giveaway, though it appears the two men did not discuss it.and Wallace\u2019s theory was unveiled to the world. Darwin himself was not present. On the day \nof the meeting, he and his wife were burying their son. \n    The Darwin\u2013Wallace presentation was one of seven that evening\u2014one of the others was on \nthe flora of Angola\u2014and if the thirty or so people in the audience had any idea that they were \nwitnessing the scientific highlight of the century, they showed no sign of it. No discussion \nfollowed. Nor did the event attract much notice elsewhere. Darwin cheerfully later noted that \nonly one person, a Professor Haughton of Dublin, mentioned the two papers in print and his \nconclusion was \u201cthat all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old.\u201d \n    Wallace, still in the distant East, learned of these maneuverings long after the event, but \nwas remarkably equable and seemed pleased to have been included at all. He even referred to \nthe theory forever after as \u201cDarwinism.\u201d Much less amenable to Darwin\u2019s claim of priority \nwas a Scottish gardener named Patrick Matthew who had, rather remarkably, also come up \nwith the principles of natural selection\u2014in fact, in the very year that Darwin had set sail in \ntheBeagle. Unfortunately, Matthew had published these views in a book called Naval Timber \nand Arboriculture, which had been missed not just by Darwin, but by the entire world. \nMatthew kicked up in a lively manner, with a letter to Gardener\u2019s Chronicle, when he saw \nDarwin gaining credit everywhere for an idea that really was his. Darwin apologized without \nhesitation, though he did note for the record: \u201cI think that no one will feel surprised that \nneither I, nor apparently any other naturalist, has heard of Mr. Matthew\u2019s views, considering \nhow briefly they are given, and they appeared in the Appendix to a work on Naval Timber \nand Arboriculture.\u201d \n    Wallace continued for another fifty years as a naturalist and thinker, occasionally a very \ngood one, but increasingly fell from scientific favor by taking up dubious interests such as \nspiritualism and the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe. So the theory \nbecame, essentially by default, Darwin\u2019s alone. \n    Darwin never ceased being tormented by his ideas. He referred to himself as \u201cthe Devil\u2019s \nChaplain\u201d and said that revealing the theory felt \u201clike confessing a murder.\u201d Apart from all \nelse, he knew it deeply pained his beloved and pious wife. Even so, he set to work at once \nexpanding his manuscript into a book-length work. Provisionally he called it An Abstract of \nan Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties through Natural Selection \u2014a title so tepid \nand tentative that his publisher, John Murray, decided to issue just five hundred copies. But \nonce presented with the manuscript, and a slightly more arresting title, Murray reconsidered \nand increased the initial print run to 1,250. \n    On the Origin of Species was an immediate commercial success, but rather less of a critical \none. Darwin\u2019s theory presented two intractable difficulties. It needed far more time than Lord \nKelvin was willing to concede, and it was scarcely supported by fossil evidence. Where, \nasked Darwin\u2019s more thoughtful critics, were the transitional forms that his theory so clearly \ncalled for? If new species were continuously evolving, then there ought to be lots of \nintermediate forms scattered across the fossil record, but there were not.3 In fact, the record as \nit existed then (and for a long time afterward) showed no life at all right up to the moment of \nthe famous Cambrian explosion. \n                                                 \n3 By coincidence, in 1861, at the height of the controversy, just such evidence turned up when workers in \nBavaria found the bones of an ancient archaeopteryx, a creature halfway between a bird and a dinosaur. (It had \nfeathers, but it also had teeth.) It was an impressive and helpful find, and its significance much debated, but a \nsingle discovery could hardly be considered conclusive.But now here was Darwin, without any evidence, insisting that the earlier seas must have \nhad abundant life and that we just hadn\u2019t found it yet because, for whatever reason, it hadn\u2019t \nbeen preserved. It simply could not be otherwise, Darwin maintained. \u201cThe case at present \nmust remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here \nentertained,\u201d he allowed most candidly, but he refused to entertain an alternative possibility. \nBy way of explanation he speculated\u2014inventively but incorrectly\u2014that perhaps the \nPrecambrian seas had been too clear to lay down sediments and thus had preserved no fossils. \n    Even Darwin\u2019s closest friends were troubled by the blitheness of some of his assertions. \nAdam Sedgwick, who had taught Darwin at Cambridge and taken him on a geological tour of \nWales in 1831, said the book gave him \u201cmore pain than pleasure.\u201d Louis Agassiz dismissed it  \nas poor conjecture. Even Lyell concluded gloomily: \u201cDarwin goes too far.\u201d \n    T. H. Huxley disliked Darwin\u2019s insistence on huge amounts of geological time because he \nwas a saltationist, which is to say a believer in the idea that evolutionary changes happen not \ngradually but suddenly. Saltationists (the word comes from the Latin for \u201cleap\u201d) couldn\u2019t \naccept that complicated organs could ever emerge in slow stages. What good, after all, is one-\ntenth of a wing or half an eye? Such organs, they thought, only made sense if they appeared in \na finished state. \n    The belief was surprising in as radical a spirit as Huxley because it closely recalled a very \nconservative religious notion first put forward by the English theologian William Paley in \n1802 and known as argument from design. Paley contended that if you found a pocket watch \non the ground, even if you had never seen such a thing before, you would instantly perceive \nthat it had been made by an intelligent entity. So it was, he believed, with nature: its \ncomplexity was proof of its design. The notion was a powerful one in the nineteenth century, \nand it gave Darwin trouble too. \u201cThe eye to this day gives me a cold shudder,\u201d he \nacknowledged in a letter to a friend. In the Origin he conceded that it \u201cseems, I freely confess, \nabsurd in the highest possible degree\u201d that natural selection could produce such an instrument \nin gradual steps. \n    Even so, and to the unending exasperation of his supporters, Darwin not only insisted that \nall change was gradual, but in nearly every edition of Origin he stepped up the amount of time \nhe supposed necessary to allow evolution to progress, which pushed his ideas increasingly out \nof favor. \u201cEventually,\u201d according to the scientist and historian Jeffrey Schwartz, \u201cDarwin lost \nvirtually all the support that still remained among the ranks of fellow natural historians and \ngeologists.\u201d \n    Ironically, considering that Darwin called his book On the Origin of Species, the one thing \nhe couldn\u2019t explain was how species originated. Darwin\u2019s theory suggested a mechanism for \nhow a species might become stronger or better or faster\u2014in a word, fitter\u2014but gave no \nindication of how it might throw up a new species. A Scottish engineer, Fleeming Jenkin, \nconsidered the problem and noted an important flaw in Darwin\u2019s argument. Darwin believed \nthat any beneficial trait that arose in one generation would be passed on to subsequent \ngenerations, thus strengthening the species. \n    Jenkin pointed out that a favorable trait in one parent wouldn\u2019t become dominant in \nsucceeding generations, but in fact would be diluted through blending. If you pour whiskey \ninto a tumbler of water, you don\u2019t make the whiskey stronger, you make it weaker. And if you \npour that dilute solution into another glass of water, it becomes weaker still. In the same way, \nany favorable trait introduced by one parent would be successively watered down bysubsequent matings until it ceased to be apparent at all. Thus Darwin\u2019s theory was not a recipe \nfor change, but for constancy. Lucky flukes might arise from time to time, but they would \nsoon vanish under the general impulse to bring everything back to a stable mediocrity. If \nnatural selection were to work, some alternative, unconsidered mechanism was required. \n    Unknown to Darwin and everyone else, eight hundred miles away in a tranquil corner of \nMiddle Europe a retiring monk named Gregor Mendel was coming up with the solution. \n    Mendel was born in 1822 to a humble farming family in a backwater of the Austrian \nempire in what is now the Czech Republic. Schoolbooks once portrayed him as a simple but \nobservant provincial monk whose discoveries were largely serendipitous\u2014the result of \nnoticing some interesting traits of inheritance while pottering about with pea plants in the \nmonastery\u2019s kitchen garden. In fact, Mendel was a trained scientist\u2014he had studied physics \nand mathematics at the Olm\u00fctz Philosophical Institute and the University of Vienna\u2014and he \nbrought scientific discipline to all he did. Moreover, the monastery at Brno where he lived \nfrom 1843 was known as a learned institution. It had a library of twenty thousand books and a \ntradition of careful scientific investigation. \n    Before embarking on his experiments, Mendel spent two years preparing his control \nspecimens, seven varieties of pea, to make sure they bred true. Then, helped by two full-time \nassistants, he repeatedly bred and crossbred hybrids from thirty thousand pea plants. It was \ndelicate work, requiring them to take the most exacting pains to avoid accidental cross-\nfertilization and to note every slight variation in the growth and appearance of seeds, pods, \nleaves, stems, and flowers. Mendel knew what he was doing. \n    He never used the word gene \u2014it wasn\u2019t coined until 1913, in an English medical \ndictionary\u2014though he did invent the terms dominant and recessive. What he established was \nthat every seed contained two \u201cfactors\u201d or \u201celemente,\u201d as he called them\u2014a dominant one \nand a recessive one\u2014and these factors, when combined, produced predictable patterns of \ninheritance. \n    The results he converted into precise mathematical formulae. Altogether Mendel spent \neight years on the experiments, then confirmed his results with similar experiments on \nflowers, corn, and other plants. If anything, Mendel was too scientific in his approach, for \nwhen he presented his findings at the February and March meetings of the Natural History \nSociety of Brno in 1865, the audience of about forty listened politely but was conspicuously \nunmoved, even though the breeding of plants was a matter of great practical interest to many \nof the members. \n    When Mendel\u2019s report was published, he eagerly sent a copy to the great Swiss botanist \nKarl-Wilhelm von N\u00e4geli, whose support was more or less vital for the theory\u2019s prospects. \nUnfortunately, N\u00e4geli failed to perceive the importance of what Mendel had found. He \nsuggested that Mendel try breeding hawkweed. Mendel obediently did as N\u00e4geli suggested, \nbut quickly realized that hawkweed had none of the requisite features for studying heritability. \nIt was evident to him that N\u00e4geli had not read the paper closely, or possibly at all. Frustrated, \nMendel retired from investigating heritability and spent the rest of his life growing \noutstanding vegetables and studying bees, mice, and sunspots, among much else. Eventually \nhe was made abbot. \n    Mendel\u2019s findings weren\u2019t quite as widely ignored as is sometimes suggested. His study \nreceived a glowing entry in the Encyclopaedia Britannica \u2014then a more leading record ofscientific thought than now\u2014and was cited repeatedly in an important paper by the German \nWilhelm Olbers Focke. Indeed, it was because Mendel\u2019s ideas never entirely sank below the \nwaterline of scientific thought that they were so easily recovered when the world was ready \nfor them. \n    Together, without realizing it, Darwin and Mendel laid the groundwork for all of life \nsciences in the twentieth century. Darwin saw that all living things are connected, that \nultimately they \u201ctrace their ancestry to a single, common source,\u201d while Mendel\u2019s work \nprovided the mechanism to explain how that could happen. The two men could easily have \nhelped each other. Mendel owned a German edition of the Origin of Species, which he is \nknown to have read, so he must have realized the applicability of his work to Darwin\u2019s, yet he \nappears to have made no effort to get in touch. And Darwin for his part is known to have \nstudied Focke\u2019s influential paper with its repeated references to Mendel\u2019s work, but didn\u2019t \nconnect them to his own studies. \n    The one thing everyone thinks featured in Darwin\u2019s argument, that humans are descended \nfrom apes, didn\u2019t feature at all except as one passing allusion. Even so, it took no great leap of \nimagination to see the implications for human development in Darwin\u2019s theories, and it \nbecame an immediate talking point. \n    The showdown came on Saturday, June 30, 1860, at a meeting of the British Association \nfor the Advancement of Science in Oxford. Huxley had been urged to attend by Robert \nChambers, author of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, though he was still unaware \nof Chambers\u2019s connection to that contentious tome. Darwin, as ever, was absent. The meeting \nwas held at the Oxford Zoological Museum. More than a thousand people crowded into the \nchamber; hundreds more were turned away. People knew that something big was going to \nhappen, though they had first to wait while a slumber-inducing speaker named John William \nDraper of New York University bravely slogged his way through two hours of introductory \nremarks on \u201cThe Intellectual Development of Europe Considered with Reference to the Views \nof Mr. Darwin.\u201d \n    Finally, the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, rose to speak. Wilberforce had been \nbriefed (or so it is generally assumed) by the ardent anti-Darwinian Richard Owen, who had \nbeen a guest in his home the night before. As nearly always with events that end in uproar, \naccounts vary widely on what exactly transpired. In the most popular version, Wilberforce, \nwhen properly in flow, turned to Huxley with a dry smile and demanded of him whether he \nclaimed attachment to the apes by way of his grandmother or grandfather. The remark was \ndoubtless intended as a quip, but it came across as an icy challenge. According to his own \naccount, Huxley turned to his neighbor and whispered, \u201cThe Lord hath delivered him into my \nhands,\u201d then rose with a certain relish. \n    Others, however, recalled a Huxley trembling with fury and indignation. At all events, \nHuxley declared that he would rather claim kinship to an ape than to someone who used his \neminence to propound uninformed twaddle in what was supposed to be a serious scientific \nforum. Such a riposte was a scandalous impertinence, as well as an insult to Wilberforce\u2019s \noffice, and the proceedings instantly collapsed in tumult. A Lady Brewster fainted. Robert \nFitzRoy, Darwin\u2019s companion on the Beagle twenty-five years before, wandered through the \nhall with a Bible held aloft, shouting, \u201cThe Book, the Book.\u201d (He was at the conference to \npresent a paper on storms in his capacity as head of the newly created Meteorological \nDepartment.) Interestingly, each side afterward claimed to have routed the other.Darwin did eventually make his belief in our kinship with the apes explicit in The Descent \nof Man in 1871. The conclusion was a bold one since nothing in the fossil record supported \nsuch a notion. The only known early human remains of that time were the famous Neandertal \nbones from Germany and a few uncertain fragments of jawbones, and many respected \nauthorities refused to believe even in their antiquity. The Descent of Man was altogether a \nmore controversial book, but by the time of its appearance the world had grown less excitable \nand its arguments caused much less of a stir. \n    For the most part, however, Darwin passed his twilight years with other projects, most of \nwhich touched only tangentially on questions of natural selection. He spent amazingly long \nperiods picking through bird droppings, scrutinizing the contents in an attempt to understand \nhow seeds spread between continents, and spent years more studying the behavior of worms. \nOne of his experiments was to play the piano to them, not to amuse them but to study the \neffects on them of sound and vibration. He was the first to realize how vitally important \nworms are to soil fertility. \u201cIt may be doubted whether there are many other animals which \nhave played so important a part in the history of the world,\u201d he wrote in his masterwork on the \nsubject, The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms (1881), which was \nactually more popular thanOn the Origin of Species had ever been. Among his other books \nwere On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by \nInsects (1862), Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), which sold almost \n5,300 copies on its first day, The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilization in the Vegetable \nKingdom (1876)\u2014a subject that came improbably close to Mendel\u2019s own work, without \nattaining anything like the same insights\u2014and his last book, The Power of Movement in \nPlants. Finally, but not least, he devoted much effort to studying the consequences of \ninbreeding\u2014a matter of private interest to him. Having married his own cousin, Darwin \nglumly suspected that certain physical and mental frailties among his children arose from a \nlack of diversity in his family tree. \n    Darwin was often honored in his lifetime, but never for On the Origin of Species orDescent \nof Man. When the Royal Society bestowed on him the prestigious Copley Medal it was for his \ngeology, zoology, and botany, not evolutionary theories, and the Linnaean Society was \nsimilarly pleased to honor Darwin without embracing his radical notions. He was never \nknighted, though he was buried in Westminster Abbey\u2014next to Newton. He died at Down in \nApril 1882. Mendel died two years later. \n    Darwin\u2019s theory didn\u2019t really gain widespread acceptance until the 1930s and 1940s, with \nthe advance of a refined theory called, with a certain hauteur, the Modern Synthesis, \ncombining Darwin\u2019s ideas with those of Mendel and others. For Mendel, appreciation was \nalso posthumous, though it came somewhat sooner. In 1900, three scientists working \nseparately in Europe rediscovered Mendel\u2019s work more or less simultaneously. It was only \nbecause one of them, a Dutchman named Hugo de Vries, seemed set to claim Mendel\u2019s \ninsights as his own that a rival made it noisily clear that the credit really lay with the forgotten \nmonk. \n    The world was almost ready, but not quite, to begin to understand how we got here\u2014how \nwe made each other. It is fairly amazing to reflect that at the beginning of the twentieth \ncentury, and for some years beyond, the best scientific minds in the world couldn\u2019t actually \ntell you where babies came from. \n    And these, you may recall, were men who thought science was nearly at an end.", "26": "26    THE STUFF OF LIFE \n \n \n \n \nIF YOUR TWO parents hadn\u2019t bonded just when they did\u2014possibly to the second, possibly \nto the nanosecond\u2014you wouldn\u2019t be here. And if their parents hadn\u2019t bonded in a precisely \ntimely manner, you wouldn\u2019t be here either. And if their parents hadn\u2019t done likewise, and \ntheir parents before them, and so on, obviously and indefinitely, you wouldn\u2019t be here. \n    Push backwards through time and these ancestral debts begin to add up. Go back just eight \ngenerations to about the time that Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln were born, and \nalready there are over 250 people on whose timely couplings your existence depends. \nContinue further, to the time of Shakespeare and the Mayflower Pilgrims, and you have no \nfewer than 16,384 ancestors earnestly exchanging genetic material in a way that would, \neventually and miraculously, result in you. \n    At twenty generations ago, the number of people procreating on your behalf has risen to \n1,048,576. Five generations before that, and there are no fewer than 33,554,432 men and \nwomen on whose devoted couplings your existence depends. By thirty generations ago, your \ntotal number of forebears\u2014remember, these aren\u2019t cousins and aunts and other incidental \nrelatives, but only parents and parents of parents in a line leading ineluctably to you\u2014is over \none billion (1,073,741,824, to be precise). If you go back sixty-four generations, to the time of \nthe Romans, the number of people on whose cooperative efforts your eventual existence \ndepends has risen to approximately 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is several thousand \ntimes the total number of people who have ever lived. \n    Clearly something has gone wrong with our math here. The answer, it may interest you to \nlearn, is that your line is not pure. You couldn\u2019t be here without a little incest\u2014actually quite \na lot of incest\u2014albeit at a genetically discreet remove. With so many millions of ancestors in \nyour background, there will have been many occasions when a relative from your mother\u2019s \nside of the family procreated with some distant cousin from your father\u2019s side of the ledger. In \nfact, if you are in a partnership now with someone from your own race and country, the \nchances are excellent that you are at some level related. Indeed, if you look around you on a \nbus or in a park or caf\u00e9 or any crowded place, most of the people you see are very probably \nrelatives. When someone boasts to you that he is descended from William the Conqueror or \nthe Mayflower Pilgrims, you should answer at once: \u201cMe, too!\u201d In the most literal and \nfundamental sense we are all family. \n    We are also uncannily alike. Compare your genes with any other human being\u2019s and on \naverage they will be about 99.9 percent the same. That is what makes us a species. The tiny \ndifferences in that remaining 0.1 percent\u2014\u201croughly one nucleotide base in every thousand,\u201d \nto quote the British geneticist and recent Nobel laureate John Sulston\u2014are what endow us \nwith our individuality. Much has been made in recent years of the unraveling of the humangenome. In fact, there is no such thing as \u201cthe\u201d human genome. Every human genome is \ndifferent. Otherwise we would all be identical. It is the endless recombinations of our \ngenomes\u2014each nearly identical, but not quite\u2014that make us what we are, both as individuals \nand as a species. \n    But what exactly is this thing we call the genome? And what, come to that, are genes? \nWell, start with a cell again. Inside the cell is a nucleus, and inside each nucleus are the \nchromosomes\u2014forty-six little bundles of complexity, of which twenty-three come from your \nmother and twenty-three from your father. With a very few exceptions, every cell in your \nbody\u201499.999 percent of them, say\u2014carries the same complement of chromosomes. (The \nexceptions are red blood cells, some immune system cells, and egg and sperm cells, which for \nvarious organizational reasons don\u2019t carry the full genetic package.) Chromosomes constitute \nthe complete set of instructions necessary to make and maintain you and are made of long \nstrands of the little wonder chemical called deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA\u2014\u201cthe most \nextraordinary molecule on Earth,\u201d as it has been called. \n    DNA exists for just one reason\u2014to create more DNA\u2014and you have a lot of it inside you: \nabout six feet of it squeezed into almost every cell. Each length of DNA comprises some 3.2 \nbillion letters of coding, enough to provide 103,480,000,000possible combinations, \u201cguaranteed to \nbe unique against all conceivable odds,\u201d in the words of Christian de Duve. That\u2019s a lot of \npossibility\u2014a one followed by more than three billion zeroes. \u201cIt would take more than five \nthousand average-size books just to print that figure,\u201d notes de Duve. Look at yourself in the \nmirror and reflect upon the fact that you are beholding ten thousand trillion cells, and that \nalmost every one of them holds two yards of densely compacted DNA, and you begin to \nappreciate just how much of this stuff you carry around with you. If all your DNA were \nwoven into a single fine strand, there would be enough of it to stretch from the Earth to the \nMoon and back not once or twice but again and again. Altogether, according to one \ncalculation, you may have as much as twenty million kilometers of DNA bundled up inside \nyou. \n    Your body, in short, loves to make DNA and without it you couldn\u2019t live. Yet DNA is not \nitself alive. No molecule is, but DNA is, as it were, especially unalive. It is \u201camong the most \nnonreactive, chemically inert molecules in the living world,\u201d in the words of the geneticist \nRichard Lewontin. That is why it can be recovered from patches of long-dried blood or semen \nin murder investigations and coaxed from the bones of ancient Neandertals. It also explains \nwhy it took scientists so long to work out how a substance so mystifyingly low key\u2014so, in a \nword, lifeless\u2014could be at the very heart of life itself. \n     As a known entity, DNA has been around longer than you might think. It was discovered \nas far back as 1869 by Johann Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss scientist working at the University \nof T\u00fcbingen in Germany. While delving microscopically through the pus in surgical \nbandages, Miescher found a substance he didn\u2019t recognize and called it nuclein (because it \nresided in the nuclei of cells). At the time, Miescher did little more than note its existence, but \nnuclein clearly remained on his mind, for twenty-three years later in a letter to his uncle he \nraised the possibility that such molecules could be the agents behind heredity. This was an \nextraordinary insight, but one so far in advance of the day\u2019s scientific requirements that it \nattracted no attention at all. \n    For most of the next half century the common assumption was that the material\u2014now \ncalled deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA\u2014had at most a subsidiary role in matters of heredity. It \nwas too simple. It had just four basic components, called nucleotides, which was like havingan alphabet of just four letters. How could you possibly write the story of life with such a \nrudimentary alphabet? (The answer is that you do it in much the way that you create complex \nmessages with the simple dots and dashes of Morse code\u2014by combining them.) DNA didn\u2019t \ndo anything at all, as far as anyone could tell. It just sat there in the nucleus, possibly binding \nthe chromosome in some way or adding a splash of acidity on command or fulfilling some \nother trivial task that no one had yet thought of. The necessary complexity, it was thought, \nhad to exist in proteins in the nucleus. \n    There were, however, two problems with dismissing DNA. First, there was so much of it: \ntwo yards in nearly every nucleus, so clearly the cells esteemed it in some important way. On \ntop of this, it kept turning up, like the suspect in a murder mystery, in experiments. In two \nstudies in particular, one involving the Pneumonococcus bacterium and another involving \nbacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria), DNA betrayed an importance that could only be \nexplained if its role were more central than prevailing thought allowed. The evidence \nsuggested that DNA was somehow involved in the making of proteins, a process vital to life, \nyet it was also clear that proteins were being made outside the nucleus, well away from the \nDNA that was supposedly directing their assembly. \n    No one could understand how DNA could possibly be getting messages to the proteins. The \nanswer, we now know, was RNA, or ribonucleic acid, which acts as an interpreter between \nthe two. It is a notable oddity of biology that DNA and proteins don\u2019t speak the same \nlanguage. For almost four billion years they have been the living world\u2019s great double act, and \nyet they answer to mutually incompatible codes, as if one spoke Spanish and the other Hindi. \nTo communicate they need a mediator in the form of RNA. Working with a kind of chemical \nclerk called a ribosome, RNA translates information from a cell\u2019s DNA into terms proteins \ncan understand and act upon. \n    However, by the early 1900s, where we resume our story, we were still a very long way \nfrom understanding that, or indeed almost anything else to do with the confused business of \nheredity. \n    Clearly there was a need for some inspired and clever experimentation, and happily the age \nproduced a young person with the diligence and aptitude to undertake it. His name was \nThomas Hunt Morgan, and in 1904, just four years after the timely rediscovery of Mendel\u2019s \nexperiments with pea plants and still almost a decade before gene would even become a word, \nhe began to do remarkably dedicated things with chromosomes. \n    Chromosomes had been discovered by chance in 1888 and were so called because they \nreadily absorbed dye and thus were easy to see under the microscope. By the turn of the \ntwentieth century it was strongly suspected that they were involved in the passing on of traits, \nbut no one knew how, or even really whether, they did this. \n    Morgan chose as his subject of study a tiny, delicate fly formally called Drosophila \nmelanogaster, but more commonly known as the fruit fly (or vinegar fly, banana fly, or \ngarbage fly). Drosophila is familiar to most of us as that frail, colorless insect that seems to \nhave a compulsive urge to drown in our drinks. As laboratory specimens fruit flies had certain \nvery attractive advantages: they cost almost nothing to house and feed, could be bred by the \nmillions in milk bottles, went from egg to productive parenthood in ten days or less, and had \njust four chromosomes, which kept things conveniently simple.Working out of a small lab (which became known inevitably as the Fly Room) in \nSchermerhorn Hall at Columbia University in New York, Morgan and his team embarked on \na program of meticulous breeding and crossbreeding involving millions of flies (one \nbiographer says billions, though that is probably an exaggeration), each of which had to be \ncaptured with tweezers and examined under a jeweler\u2019s glass for any tiny variations in \ninheritance. For six years they tried to produce mutations by any means they could think of\u2014\nzapping the flies with radiation and X-rays, rearing them in bright light and darkness, baking \nthem gently in ovens, spinning them crazily in centrifuges\u2014but nothing worked. Morgan was \non the brink of giving up when there occurred a sudden and repeatable mutation\u2014a fly that \nhad white eyes rather than the usual red ones. With this breakthrough, Morgan and his \nassistants were able to generate useful deformities, allowing them to track a trait through \nsuccessive generations. By such means they could work out the correlations between \nparticular characteristics and individual chromosomes, eventually proving to more or less \neveryone\u2019s satisfaction that chromosomes were at the heart of inheritance. \n    The problem, however, remained the next level of biological intricacy: the enigmatic genes \nand the DNA that composed them. These were much trickier to isolate and understand. As \nlate as 1933, when Morgan was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work, many researchers still \nweren\u2019t convinced that genes even existed. As Morgan noted at the time, there was no \nconsensus \u201cas to what the genes are\u2014whether they are real or purely fictitious.\u201d It may seem \nsurprising that scientists could struggle to accept the physical reality of something so \nfundamental to cellular activity, but as Wallace, King, and Sanders point out in Biology: The \nScience of Life (that rarest thing: a readable college text), we are in much the same position \ntoday with mental processes such as thought and memory. We know that we have them, of \ncourse, but we don\u2019t know what, if any, physical form they take. So it was for the longest time \nwith genes. The idea that you could pluck one from your body and take it away for study was \nas absurd to many of Morgan\u2019s peers as the idea that scientists today might capture a stray \nthought and examine it under a microscope. \n    What was certainly true was that something associated with chromosomes was directing \ncell replication. Finally, in 1944, after fifteen years of effort, a team at the Rockefeller \nInstitute in Manhattan, led by a brilliant but diffident Canadian named Oswald Avery, \nsucceeded with an exceedingly tricky experiment in which an innocuous strain of bacteria was \nmade permanently infectious by crossing it with alien DNA, proving that DNA was far more \nthan a passive molecule and almost certainly was the active agent in heredity. The Austrian-\nborn biochemist Erwin Chargaff later suggested quite seriously that Avery\u2019s discovery was \nworth two Nobel Prizes. \n    Unfortunately, Avery was opposed by one of his own colleagues at the institute, a strong-\nwilled and disagreeable protein enthusiast named Alfred Mirsky, who did everything in his \npower to discredit Avery\u2019s work\u2014including, it has been said, lobbying the authorities at the \nKarolinska Institute in Stockholm not to give Avery a Nobel Prize. Avery by this time was \nsixty-six years old and tired. Unable to deal with the stress and controversy, he resigned his \nposition and never went near a lab again. But other experiments elsewhere overwhelmingly \nsupported his conclusions, and soon the race was on to find the structure of DNA. \n   Had you been a betting person in the early 1950s, your money would almost certainly have \nbeen on Linus Pauling of Caltech, America\u2019s leading chemist, to crack the structure of DNA. \nPauling was unrivaled in determining the architecture of molecules and had been a pioneer in \nthe field of X-ray crystallography, a technique that would prove crucial to peering into the \nheart of DNA. In an exceedingly distinguished career, he would win two Nobel Prizes (forchemistry in 1954 and peace in 1962), but with DNA he became convinced that the structure \nwas a triple helix, not a double one, and never quite got on the right track. Instead, victory fell \nto an unlikely quartet of scientists in England who didn\u2019t work as a team, often weren\u2019t on \nspeaking terms, and were for the most part novices in the field. \n    Of the four, the nearest to a conventional boffin was Maurice Wilkins, who had spent much \nof the Second World War helping to design the atomic bomb. Two of the others, Rosalind \nFranklin and Francis Crick, had passed their war years working on mines for the British \ngovernment\u2014Crick of the type that blow up, Franklin of the type that produce coal. \n    The most unconventional of the foursome was James Watson, an American prodigy who \nhad distinguished himself as a boy as a member of a highly popular radio program called The \nQuiz Kids (and thus could claim to be at least part of the inspiration for some of the members \nof the Glass family in Franny and Zooey and other works by J. D. Salinger) and who had \nentered the University of Chicago aged just fifteen. He had earned his Ph.D. by the age of \ntwenty-two and was now attached to the famous Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. In \n1951, he was a gawky twenty-three-year-old with a strikingly lively head of hair that appears \nin photographs to be straining to attach itself to some powerful magnet just out of frame. \n    Crick, twelve years older and still without a doctorate, was less memorably hirsute and \nslightly more tweedy. In Watson\u2019s account he is presented as blustery, nosy, cheerfully \nargumentative, impatient with anyone slow to share a notion, and constantly in danger of \nbeing asked to go elsewhere. Neither was formally trained in biochemistry. \n    Their assumption was that if you could determine the shape of a DNA molecule you would \nbe able to see\u2014correctly, as it turned out\u2014how it did what it did. They hoped to achieve this, \nit would appear, by doing as little work as possible beyond thinking, and no more of that than \nwas absolutely necessary. As Watson cheerfully (if a touch disingenuously) remarked in his \nautobiographical book The Double Helix, \u201cIt was my hope that the gene might be solved \nwithout my learning any chemistry.\u201d They weren\u2019t actually assigned to work on DNA, and at \none point were ordered to stop it. Watson was ostensibly mastering the art of crystallography; \nCrick was supposed to be completing a thesis on the X-ray diffraction of large molecules. \n    Although Crick and Watson enjoy nearly all the credit in popular accounts for solving the \nmystery of DNA, their breakthrough was crucially dependent on experimental work done by \ntheir competitors, the results of which were obtained \u201cfortuitously,\u201d in the tactful words of the \nhistorian Lisa Jardine. Far ahead of them, at least at the beginning, were two academics at \nKing\u2019s College in London, Wilkins and Franklin. \n    The New Zealand\u2013born Wilkins was a retiring figure, almost to the point of invisibility. A \n1998 PBS documentary on the discovery of the structure of DNA\u2014a feat for which he shared \nthe 1962 Nobel Prize with Crick and Watson\u2014managed to overlook him entirely. \n    The most enigmatic character of all was Franklin. In a severely unflattering portrait, \nWatson in The Double Helix depicted Franklin as a woman who was unreasonable, secretive, \nchronically uncooperative, and\u2014this seemed especially to irritate him\u2014almost willfully \nunsexy. He allowed that she \u201cwas not unattractive and might have been quite stunning had she \ntaken even a mild interest in clothes,\u201d but in this she disappointed all expectations. She didn\u2019teven use lipstick, he noted in wonder, while her dress sense \u201cshowed all the imagination of \nEnglish blue-stocking adolescents.\u201d1  \n    However, she did have the best images in existence of the possible structure of DNA, \nachieved by means of X-ray crystallography, the technique perfected by Linus Pauling. \nCrystallography had been used successfully to map atoms in crystals (hence \n\u201ccrystallography\u201d), but DNA molecules were a much more finicky proposition. Only Franklin \nwas managing to get good results from the process, but to Wilkins\u2019s perennial exasperation \nshe refused to share her findings. \n    If Franklin was not warmly forthcoming with her findings, she cannot be altogether \nblamed. Female academics at King\u2019s in the 1950s were treated with a formalized disdain that \ndazzles modern sensibilities (actually any sensibilities). However senior or accomplished, \nthey were not allowed into the college\u2019s senior common room but instead had to take their \nmeals in a more utilitarian chamber that even Watson conceded was \u201cdingily pokey.\u201d On top \nof this she was being constantly pressed\u2014at times actively harassed\u2014to share her results with \na trio of men whose desperation to get a peek at them was seldom matched by more engaging \nqualities, like respect. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we always used to adopt\u2014let\u2019s say a patronizing attitude \ntoward her,\u201d Crick later recalled. Two of these men were from a competing institution and the \nthird was more or less openly siding with them. It should hardly come as a surprise that she \nkept her results locked away. \n    That Wilkins and Franklin did not get along was a fact that Watson and Crick seem to have \nexploited to their benefit. Although Crick and Watson were trespassing rather unashamedly \non Wilkins\u2019s territory, it was with them that he increasingly sided\u2014not altogether surprisingly \nsince Franklin herself was beginning to act in a decidedly queer way. Although her results \nshowed that DNA definitely was helical in shape, she insisted to all that it was not. To \nWilkins\u2019s presumed dismay and embarrassment, in the summer of 1952 she posted a mock \nnotice around the King\u2019s physics department that said: \u201cIt is with great regret that we have to \nannounce the death, on Friday 18th July 1952 of D.N.A. helix. . . . It is hoped that Dr. M.H.F. \nWilkins will speak in memory of the late helix.\u201d \n    The outcome of all this was that in January 1953, Wilkins showed Watson Franklin\u2019s \nimages, \u201capparently without her knowledge or consent.\u201d It would be an understatement to call \nit a significant help. Years later Watson conceded that it \u201cwas the key event . . . it mobilized \nus.\u201d Armed with the knowledge of the DNA molecule\u2019s basic shape and some important \nelements of its dimensions, Watson and Crick redoubled their efforts. Everything now seemed \nto go their way. At one point Pauling was en route to a conference in England at which he \nwould in all likelihood have met with Wilkins and learned enough to correct the \nmisconceptions that had put him on the wrong line of inquiry, but this was the McCarthy era \nand Pauling found himself detained at Idlewild Airport in New York, his passport confiscated, \non the grounds that he was too liberal of temperament to be allowed to travel abroad. Crick \nand Watson also had the no less convenient good fortune that Pauling\u2019s son was working at \nthe Cavendish and innocently kept them abreast of any news of developments and setbacks at \nhome. \n    Still facing the possibility of being trumped at any moment, Watson and Crick applied \nthemselves feverishly to the problem. It was known that DNA had four chemical \n                                                 \n1 In 1968, Harvard University Press canceled publication of The Double Helix after Crick and Wilkins \ncomplained about its characterizations, which the science historian Lisa Jardine has described as \"gratuitously \nhurtful.\" The descriptions quoted above are after Watson softened his comments.components\u2014called adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thiamine\u2014and that these paired up in \nparticular ways. By playing with pieces of cardboard cut into the shapes of molecules, Watson \nand Crick were able to work out how the pieces fit together. From this they made a Meccano-\nlike model\u2014perhaps the most famous in modern science\u2014consisting of metal plates bolted \ntogether in a spiral, and invited Wilkins, Franklin, and the rest of the world to have a look. \nAny informed person could see at once that they had solved the problem. It was without \nquestion a brilliant piece of detective work, with or without the boost of Franklin\u2019s picture. \n    The April 25, 1953, edition of Nature carried a 900-word article by Watson and Crick titled \n\u201cA Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid.\u201d Accompanying it were separate articles by \nWilkins and Franklin. It was an eventful time in the world\u2014Edmund Hillary was just about to \nclamber to the top of Everest while Elizabeth II was imminently to be crowned queen of \nEngland\u2014so the discovery of the secret of life was mostly overlooked. It received a small \nmention in the News Chronicle and was ignored elsewhere. \n    Rosalind Franklin did not share in the Nobel Prize. She died of ovarian cancer at the age of \njust thirty-seven in 1958, four years before the award was granted. Nobel Prizes are not \nawarded posthumously. The cancer almost certainly arose as a result of chronic overexposure \nto X-rays through her work and needn\u2019t have happened. In her much-praised 2002 biography \nof Franklin, Brenda Maddox noted that Franklin rarely wore a lead apron and often stepped \ncarelessly in front of a beam. Oswald Avery never won a Nobel Prize either and was also \nlargely overlooked by posterity, though he did at least have the satisfaction of living just long \nenough to see his findings vindicated. He died in 1955. \n     Watson and Crick\u2019s discovery wasn\u2019t actually confirmed until the 1980s. As Crick said in \none of his books: \u201cIt took over twenty-five years for our model of DNA to go from being only \nrather plausible, to being very plausible . . . and from there to being virtually certainly \ncorrect.\u201d \n    Even so, with the structure of DNA understood progress in genetics was swift, and by 1968 \nthe journal Science could run an article titled \u201cThat Was the Molecular Biology That Was,\u201d \nsuggesting\u2014it hardly seems possible, but it is so\u2014that the work of genetics was nearly at an \nend. \n    In fact, of course, it was only just beginning. Even now there is a great deal about DNA that \nwe scarcely understand, not least why so much of it doesn\u2019t actually seem to do anything. \nNinety-seven percent of your DNA consists of nothing but long stretches of meaningless \ngarble\u2014\u201cjunk,\u201d or \u201cnon-coding DNA,\u201d as biochemists prefer to put it. Only here and there \nalong each strand do you find sections that control and organize vital functions. These are the \ncurious and long-elusive genes. \n    Genes are nothing more (nor less) than instructions to make proteins. This they do with a \ncertain dull fidelity. In this sense, they are rather like the keys of a piano, each playing a \nsingle note and nothing else, which is obviously a trifle monotonous. But combine the genes, \nas you would combine piano keys, and you can create chords and melodies of infinite variety. \nPut all these genes together, and you have (to continue the metaphor) the great symphony of \nexistence known as the human genome. \n    An alternative and more common way to regard the genome is as a kind of instruction \nmanual for the body. Viewed this way, the chromosomes can be imagined as the book\u2019s \nchapters and the genes as individual instructions for making proteins. The words in which theinstructions are written are called codons, and the letters are known as bases. The bases\u2014the \nletters of the genetic alphabet\u2014consist of the four nucleotides mentioned a page or two back: \nadenine, thiamine, guanine, and cytosine. Despite the importance of what they do, these \nsubstances are not made of anything exotic. Guanine, for instance, is the same stuff that \nabounds in, and gives its name to, guano. \n    The shape of a DNA molecule, as everyone knows, is rather like a spiral staircase or \ntwisted rope ladder: the famous double helix. The uprights of this structure are made of a type \nof sugar called deoxyribose, and the whole of the helix is a nucleic acid\u2014hence the name \n\u201cdeoxyribonucleic acid.\u201d The rungs (or steps) are formed by two bases joining across the \nspace between, and they can combine in only two ways: guanine is always paired with \ncytosine and thiamine always with adenine. The order in which these letters appear as you \nmove up or down the ladder constitutes the DNA code; logging it has been the job of the \nHuman Genome Project. \n    Now the particular brilliance of DNA lies in its manner of replication. When it is time to \nproduce a new DNA molecule, the two strands part down the middle, like the zipper on a \njacket, and each half goes off to form a new partnership. Because each nucleotide along a \nstrand pairs up with a specific other nucleotide, each strand serves as a template for the \ncreation of a new matching strand. If you possessed just one strand of your own DNA, you \ncould easily enough reconstruct the matching side by working out the necessary partnerships: \nif the topmost rung on one strand was made of guanine, then you would know that the \ntopmost rung on the matching strand must be cytosine. Work your way down the ladder \nthrough all the nucleotide pairings, and eventually you would have the code for a new \nmolecule. That is just what happens in nature, except that nature does it really quickly\u2014in \nonly a matter of seconds, which is quite a feat. \n    Most of the time our DNA replicates with dutiful accuracy, but just occasionally\u2014about \none time in a million\u2014a letter gets into the wrong place. This is known as a single nucleotide \npolymorphism, or SNP, familiarly known to biochemists as a \u201cSnip.\u201d Generally these Snips \nare buried in stretches of noncoding DNA and have no detectable consequence for the body. \nBut occasionally they make a difference. They might leave you predisposed to some disease, \nbut equally they might confer some slight advantage\u2014more protective pigmentation, for \ninstance, or increased production of red blood cells for someone living at altitude. Over time, \nthese slight modifications accumulate in both individuals and in populations, contributing to \nthe distinctiveness of both. \n    The balance between accuracy and errors in replication is a fine one. Too many errors and \nthe organism can\u2019t function, but too few and it sacrifices adaptability. A similar balance must \nexist between stability in an organism and innovation. An increase in red blood cells can help \na person or group living at high elevations to move and breathe more easily because more red \ncells can carry more oxygen. But additional red cells also thicken the blood. Add too many, \nand \u201cit\u2019s like pumping oil,\u201d in the words of Temple University anthropologist Charles Weitz. \nThat\u2019s hard on the heart. Thus those designed to live at high altitude get increased breathing \nefficiency, but pay for it with higher-risk hearts. By such means does Darwinian natural \nselection look after us. It also helps to explain why we are all so similar. Evolution simply \nwon\u2019t let you become too different\u2014not without becoming a new species anyway. \n    The 0.1 percent difference between your genes and mine is accounted for by our Snips. \nNow if you compared your DNA with a third person\u2019s, there would also be 99.9 percent \ncorrespondence, but the Snips would, for the most part, be in different places. Add morepeople to the comparison and you will get yet more Snips in yet more places. For every one of \nyour 3.2 billion bases, somewhere on the planet there will be a person, or group of persons, \nwith different coding in that position. So not only is it wrong to refer to \u201cthe\u201d human genome, \nbut in a sense we don\u2019t even have \u201ca\u201d human genome. We have six billion of them. We are all \n99.9 percent the same, but equally, in the words of the biochemist David Cox, \u201cyou could say \nall humans share nothing, and that would be correct, too.\u201d \n    But we have still to explain why so little of that DNA has any discernible purpose. It starts \nto get a little unnerving, but it does really seem that the purpose of life is to perpetuate DNA. \nThe 97 percent of our DNA commonly called junk is largely made up of clumps of letters \nthat, in Ridley\u2019s words, \u201cexist for the pure and simple reason that they are good at getting \nthemselves duplicated.\u201d2 Most of your DNA, in other words, is not devoted to you but to \nitself: you are a machine for reproducing it, not it for you. Life, you will recall, just wants to \nbe, and DNA is what makes it so. \n    Even when DNA includes instructions for making genes\u2014when it codes for them, as \nscientists put it\u2014it is not necessarily with the smooth functioning of the organism in mind. \nOne of the commonest genes we have is for a protein called reverse transcriptase, which has \nno known beneficial function in human beings at all. The one thing itdoes do is make it \npossible for retroviruses, such as the AIDS virus, to slip unnoticed into the human system. \n    In other words, our bodies devote considerable energies to producing a protein that does \nnothing that is beneficial and sometimes clobbers us. Our bodies have no choice but to do so \nbecause the genes order it. We are vessels for their whims. Altogether, almost half of human \ngenes\u2014the largest proportion yet found in any organism\u2014don\u2019t do anything at all, as far as \nwe can tell, except reproduce themselves. \n    All organisms are in some sense slaves to their genes. That\u2019s why salmon and spiders and \nother types of creatures more or less beyond counting are prepared to die in the process of \nmating. The desire to breed, to disperse one\u2019s genes, is the most powerful impulse in nature. \nAs Sherwin B. Nuland has put it: \u201cEmpires fall, ids explode, great symphonies are written, \nand behind all of it is a single instinct that demands satisfaction.\u201d From an evolutionary point \nof view, sex is really just a reward mechanism to encourage us to pass on our genetic material. \n     Scientists had only barely absorbed the surprising news that most of our DNA doesn\u2019t do \nanything when even more unexpected findings began to turn up. First in Germany and then in \nSwitzerland researchers performed some rather bizarre experiments that produced curiously \nunbizarre outcomes. In one they took the gene that controlled the development of a mouse\u2019s \neye and inserted it into the larva of a fruit fly. The thought was that it might produce \nsomething interestingly grotesque. In fact, the mouse-eye gene not only made a viable eye in \nthe fruit fly, it made a fly\u2019s eye. Here were two creatures that hadn\u2019t shared a common \nancestor for 500 million years, yet could swap genetic material as if they were sisters. \n    The story was the same wherever researchers looked. They found that they could insert \nhuman DNA into certain cells of flies, and the flies would accept it as if it were their own. \n                                                 \n2 Junk DNA does have a use. It is the portion employed in DNA fingerprinting. Its practicality for this purpose \nwas discovered accidentally by Alec Jeffreys, a scientist at the University of Leicester in England. In 1986 \nJeffreys was studying DNA sequences for genetic markers associated with heritable diseases when he was \napproached by the police and asked if he could help connect a suspect to two murders. He realized his technique \nought to work perfectly for solving criminal cases-and so it proved. A young baker with the improbable name of \nColin Pitchfork was sentenced to two life terms in prison for the murders.Over 60 percent of human genes, it turns out, are fundamentally the same as those found in \nfruit flies. At least 90 percent correlate at some level to those found in mice. (We even have \nthe same genes for making a tail, if only they would switch on.) In field after field, \nresearchers found that whatever organism they were working on\u2014whether nematode worms \nor human beings\u2014they were often studying essentially the same genes. Life, it appeared, was \ndrawn up from a single set of blueprints. \n    Further probings revealed the existence of a clutch of master control genes, each directing \nthe development of a section of the body, which were dubbed homeotic (from a Greek word \nmeaning \u201csimilar\u201d) or hox genes. Hox genes answered the long-bewildering question of how \nbillions of embryonic cells, all arising from a single fertilized egg and carrying identical \nDNA, know where to go and what to do\u2014that this one should become a liver cell, this one a \nstretchy neuron, this one a bubble of blood, this one part of the shimmer on a beating wing. It \nis the hox genes that instruct them, and they do it for all organisms in much the same way. \n    Interestingly, the amount of genetic material and how it is organized doesn\u2019t necessarily, or \neven generally, reflect the level of sophistication of the creature that contains it. We have \nforty-six chromosomes, but some ferns have more than six hundred. The lungfish, one of the \nleast evolved of all complex animals, has forty times as much DNA as we have. Even the \ncommon newt is more genetically splendorous than we are, by a factor of five. \n    Clearly it is not the number of genes you have, but what you do with them. This is a very \ngood thing because the number of genes in humans has taken a big hit lately. Until recently it \nwas thought that humans had at least 100,000 genes, possibly a good many more, but that \nnumber was drastically reduced by the first results of the Human Genome Project, which \nsuggested a figure more like 35,000 or 40,000 genes\u2014about the same number as are found in \ngrass. That came as both a surprise and a disappointment. \n    It won\u2019t have escaped your attention that genes have been commonly implicated in any \nnumber of human frailties. Exultant scientists have at various times declared themselves to \nhave found the genes responsible for obesity, schizophrenia, homosexuality, criminality, \nviolence, alcoholism, even shoplifting and homelessness. Perhaps the apogee (or nadir) of this \nfaith in biodeterminism was a study published in the journal Science in 1980 contending that \nwomen are genetically inferior at mathematics. In fact, we now know, almost nothing about \nyou is so accommodatingly simple. \n    This is clearly a pity in one important sense, for if you had individual genes that determined \nheight or propensity to diabetes or to baldness or any other distinguishing trait, then it would \nbe easy\u2014comparatively easy anyway\u2014to isolate and tinker with them. Unfortunately, thirty-\nfive thousand genes functioning independently is not nearly enough to produce the kind of \nphysical complexity that makes a satisfactory human being. Genes clearly therefore must \ncooperate. A few disorders\u2014hemophilia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, and \ncystic fibrosis, for example\u2014are caused by lone dysfunctional genes, but as a rule disruptive \ngenes are weeded out by natural selection long before they can become permanently \ntroublesome to a species or population. For the most part our fate and comfort\u2014and even our \neye color\u2014are determined not by individual genes but by complexes of genes working in \nalliance. That\u2019s why it is so hard to work out how it all fits together and why we won\u2019t be \nproducing designer babies anytime soon. \n    In fact, the more we have learned in recent years the more complicated matters have tended \nto become. Even thinking, it turns out, affects the ways genes work. How fast a man\u2019s beardgrows, for instance, is partly a function of how much he thinks about sex (because thinking \nabout sex produces a testosterone surge). In the early 1990s, scientists made an even more \nprofound discovery when they found they could knock out supposedly vital genes from \nembryonic mice, and the mice were not only often born healthy, but sometimes were actually \nfitter than their brothers and sisters who had not been tampered with. When certain important \ngenes were destroyed, it turned out, others were stepping in to fill the breach. This was \nexcellent news for us as organisms, but not so good for our understanding of how cells work \nsince it introduced an extra layer of complexity to something that we had barely begun to \nunderstand anyway. \n    It is largely because of these complicating factors that cracking the human genome became \nseen almost at once as only a beginning. The genome, as Eric Lander of MIT has put it, is like \na parts list for the human body: it tells us what we are made of, but says nothing about how \nwe work. What\u2019s needed now is the operating manual\u2014instructions for how to make it go. \nWe are not close to that point yet. \n    So now the quest is to crack the human proteome\u2014a concept so novel that the term \nproteome didn\u2019t even exist a decade ago. The proteome is the library of information that \ncreates proteins. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d observed Scientific American in the spring of 2002, \u201cthe \nproteome is much more complicated than the genome.\u201d \n    That\u2019s putting it mildly. Proteins, you will remember, are the workhorses of all living \nsystems; as many as a hundred million of them may be busy in any cell at any moment. That\u2019s \na lot of activity to try to figure out. Worse, proteins\u2019 behavior and functions are based not \nsimply on their chemistry, as with genes, but also on their shapes. To function, a protein must \nnot only have the necessary chemical components, properly assembled, but then must also be \nfolded into an extremely specific shape. \u201cFolding\u201d is the term that\u2019s used, but it\u2019s a \nmisleading one as it suggests a geometrical tidiness that doesn\u2019t in fact apply. Proteins loop \nand coil and crinkle into shapes that are at once extravagant and complex. They are more like \nfuriously mangled coat hangers than folded towels. \n    Moreover, proteins are (if I may be permitted to use a handy archaism) the swingers of the \nbiological world. Depending on mood and metabolic circumstance, they will allow \nthemselves to be phosphorylated, glycosylated, acetylated, ubiquitinated, farneysylated, \nsulfated, and linked to glycophosphatidylinositol anchors, among rather a lot else. Often it \ntakes relatively little to get them going, it appears. Drink a glass of wine, as Scientific \nAmerican notes, and you materially alter the number and types of proteins at large in your \nsystem. This is a pleasant feature for drinkers, but not nearly so helpful for geneticists who are \ntrying to understand what is going on. \n    It can all begin to seem impossibly complicated, and in some ways itis impossibly \ncomplicated. But there is an underlying simplicity in all this, too, owing to an equally \nelemental underlying unity in the way life works. All the tiny, deft chemical processes that \nanimate cells\u2014the cooperative efforts of nucleotides, the transcription of DNA into RNA\u2014\nevolved just once and have stayed pretty well fixed ever since across the whole of nature. As \nthe late French geneticist Jacques Monod put it, only half in jest: \u201cAnything that is true of E. \ncoli must be true of elephants, except more so.\u201d \n    Every living thing is an elaboration on a single original plan. As humans we are mere \nincrements\u2014each of us a musty archive of adjustments, adaptations, modifications, and \nprovidential tinkerings stretching back 3.8 billion years. Remarkably, we are even quiteclosely related to fruit and vegetables. About half the chemical functions that take place in a \nbanana are fundamentally the same as the chemical functions that take place in you. \n    It cannot be said too often: all life is one. That is, and I suspect will forever prove to be, the \nmost profound true statement there is.PART  VI    THE ROAD TO US \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDescended from the apes! My dear,  \n \n \n \n \nlet us hope that it is not true, but if it is,  \n \n \n \n \nlet us pray that it will not become  \n \n \n \n \ngenerally known. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-Remark attributed to the wife of \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe Bishop of Worcester after \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDarwin\u2019s theory of evolution was \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExplained to her", "27": "27    ICE TIME \n \n \n \nI had a dream, which was not  \n   all a dream. \nThe bright sun was  \n   extinguish\u2019d, and the stars \nDid wander . . . \n\u2014Byron, \u201cDarkness\u201d \n \nIN 1815 on the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia, a handsome and long-quiescent mountain \nnamed Tambora exploded spectacularly, killing a hundred thousand people with its blast and \nassociated tsunamis. It was the biggest volcanic explosion in ten thousand years\u2014150 times \nthe size of Mount St. Helens, equivalent to sixty thousand Hiroshima-sized atom bombs. \n    News didn\u2019t travel terribly fast in those days. In London, The Times ran a small story\u2014\nactually a letter from a merchant\u2014seven months after the event. But by this time Tambora\u2019s \neffects were already being felt. Thirty-six cubic miles of smoky ash, dust, and grit had \ndiffused through the atmosphere, obscuring the Sun\u2019s rays and causing the Earth to cool. \nSunsets were unusually but blearily colorful, an effect memorably captured by the artist J. M. \nW. Turner, who could not have been happier, but mostly the world existed under an \noppressive, dusky pall. It was this deathly dimness that inspired the Byron lines above. \n    Spring never came and summer never warmed: 1816 became known as the year without \nsummer. Crops everywhere failed to grow. In Ireland a famine and associated typhoid \nepidemic killed sixty-five thousand people. In New England, the year became popularly \nknown as Eighteen Hundred and Froze to Death. Morning frosts continued until June and \nalmost no planted seed would grow. Short of fodder, livestock died or had to be prematurely \nslaughtered. In every way it was a dreadful year\u2014almost certainly the worst for farmers in \nmodern times. Yet globally the temperature fell by only about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Earth\u2019s \nnatural thermostat, as scientists would learn, is an exceedingly delicate instrument. \n    The nineteenth century was already a chilly time. For two hundred years Europe and North \nAmerica in particular had experienced a Little Ice Age, as it has become known, which \npermitted all kinds of wintry events\u2014frost fairs on the Thames, ice-skating races along Dutch \ncanals\u2014that are mostly impossible now. It was a period, in other words, when frigidity was \nmuch on people\u2019s minds. So we may perhaps excuse nineteenth-century geologists for being \nslow to realize that the world they lived in was in fact balmy compared with former epochs, \nand that much of the land around them had been shaped by crushing glaciers and cold that \nwould wreck even a frost fair. \n    They knew there was something odd about the past. The European landscape was littered \nwith inexplicable anomalies\u2014the bones of arctic reindeer in the warm south of France, huge \nrocks stranded in improbable places\u2014and they often came up with inventive but not terriblyplausible explanations. One French naturalist named de Luc, trying to explain how granite \nboulders had come to rest high up on the limestone flanks of the Jura Mountains, suggested \nthat perhaps they had been shot there by compressed air in caverns, like corks out of a \npopgun. The term for a displaced boulder is an erratic, but in the nineteenth century the \nexpression seemed to apply more often to the theories than to the rocks. \n    The great British geologist Arthur Hallam has suggested that if James Hutton, the father of \ngeology, had visited Switzerland, he would have seen at once the significance of the carved \nvalleys, the polished striations, the telltale strand lines where rocks had been dumped, and the \nother abundant clues that point to passing ice sheets. Unfortunately, Hutton was not a traveler. \nBut even with nothing better at his disposal than secondhand accounts, Hutton rejected out of \nhand the idea that huge boulders had been carried three thousand feet up mountainsides by \nfloods\u2014all the water in the world won\u2019t make a boulder float, he pointed out\u2014and became \none of the first to argue for widespread glaciation. Unfortunately his ideas escaped notice, and \nfor another half century most naturalists continued to insist that the gouges on rocks could be \nattributed to passing carts or even the scrape of hobnailed boots. \n    Local peasants, uncontaminated by scientific orthodoxy, knew better, however. The \nnaturalist Jean de Charpentier told the story of how in 1834 he was walking along a country \nlane with a Swiss woodcutter when they got to talking about the rocks along the roadside. The \nwoodcutter matter-of-factly told him that the boulders had come from the Grimsel, a zone of \ngranite some distance away. \u201cWhen I asked him how he thought that these stones had reached \ntheir location, he answered without hesitation: \u2018The Grimsel glacier transported them on both \nsides of the valley, because that glacier extended in the past as far as the town of Bern.\u2019 \u201d \n    Charpentier was delighted. He had come to such a view himself, but when he raised the \nnotion at scientific gatherings, it was dismissed. One of Charpentier\u2019s closest friends was \nanother Swiss naturalist, Louis Agassiz, who after some initial skepticism came to embrace, \nand eventually all but appropriate, the theory. \n    Agassiz had studied under Cuvier in Paris and now held the post of Professor of Natural \nHistory at the College of Neuch\u00e2tel in Switzerland. Another friend of Agassiz\u2019s, a botanist \nnamed Karl Schimper, was actually the first to coin the term ice age (in German Eiszeit ), in \n1837, and to propose that there was good evidence to show that ice had once lain heavily \nacross not just the Swiss Alps, but over much of Europe, Asia, and North America. It was a \nradical notion. He lent Agassiz his notes\u2014then came very much to regret it as Agassiz \nincreasingly got the credit for what Schimper felt, with some legitimacy, was his theory. \nCharpentier likewise ended up a bitter enemy of his old friend. Alexander von Humboldt, yet \nanother friend, may have had Agassiz at least partly in mind when he observed that there are \nthree stages in scientific discovery: first, people deny that it is true; then they deny that it is \nimportant; finally they credit the wrong person. \n    At all events, Agassiz made the field his own. In his quest to understand the dynamics of \nglaciation, he went everywhere\u2014deep into dangerous crevasses and up to the summits of the \ncraggiest Alpine peaks, often apparently unaware that he and his team were the first to climb \nthem. Nearly everywhere Agassiz encountered an unyielding reluctance to accept his theories. \nHumboldt urged him to return to his area of real expertise, fossil fish, and give up this mad \nobsession with ice, but Agassiz was a man possessed by an idea. \n    Agassiz\u2019s theory found even less support in Britain, where most naturalists had never seen \na glacier and often couldn\u2019t grasp the crushing forces that ice in bulk exerts. \u201cCould scratchesand polish just be due to ice ?\u201d asked Roderick Murchison in a mocking tone at one meeting, \nevidently imagining the rocks as covered in a kind of light and glassy rime. To his dying day, \nhe expressed the frankest incredulity at those \u201cice-mad\u201d geologists who believed that glaciers \ncould account for so much. William Hopkins, a Cambridge professor and leading member of \nthe Geological Society, endorsed this view, arguing that the notion that ice could transport \nboulders presented \u201csuch obvious mechanical absurdities\u201d as to make it unworthy of the \nsociety\u2019s attention. \n    Undaunted, Agassiz traveled tirelessly to promote his theory. In 1840 he read a paper to a \nmeeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Glasgow at which he \nwas openly criticized by the great Charles Lyell. The following year the Geological Society of \nEdinburgh passed a resolution conceding that there might be some general merit in the theory \nbut that certainly none of it applied to Scotland. \n    Lyell did eventually come round. His moment of epiphany came when he realized that a \nmoraine, or line of rocks, near his family estate in Scotland, which he had passed hundreds of \ntimes, could only be understood if one accepted that a glacier had dropped them there. But \nhaving become converted, Lyell then lost his nerve and backed off from public support of the \nIce Age idea. It was a frustrating time for Agassiz. His marriage was breaking up, Schimper \nwas hotly accusing him of the theft of his ideas, Charpentier wouldn\u2019t speak to him, and the \ngreatest living geologist offered support of only the most tepid and vacillating kind. \n    In 1846, Agassiz traveled to America to give a series of lectures and there at last found the \nesteem he craved. Harvard gave him a professorship and built him a first-rate museum, the \nMuseum of Comparative Zoology. Doubtless it helped that he had settled in New England, \nwhere the long winters encouraged a certain sympathy for the idea of interminable periods of \ncold. It also helped that six years after his arrival the first scientific expedition to Greenland \nreported that nearly the whole of that semicontinent was covered in an ice sheet just like the \nancient one imagined in Agassiz\u2019s theory. At long last, his ideas began to find a real \nfollowing. The one central defect of Agassiz\u2019s theory was that his ice ages had no cause. But \nassistance was about to come from an unlikely quarter. \n    In the 1860s, journals and other learned publications in Britain began to receive papers on \nhydrostatics, electricity, and other scientific subjects from a James Croll of Anderson\u2019s \nUniversity in Glasgow. One of the papers, on how variations in Earth\u2019s orbit might have \nprecipitated ice ages, was published in the Philosophical Magazine in 1864 and was \nrecognized at once as a work of the highest standard. So there was some surprise, and perhaps \njust a touch of embarrassment, when it turned out that Croll was not an academic at the \nuniversity, but a janitor. \n    Born in 1821, Croll grew up poor, and his formal education lasted only to the age of \nthirteen. He worked at a variety of jobs\u2014as a carpenter, insurance salesman, keeper of a \ntemperance hotel\u2014before taking a position as a janitor at Anderson\u2019s (now the University of \nStrathclyde) in Glasgow. By somehow inducing his brother to do much of his work, he was \nable to pass many quiet evenings in the university library teaching himself physics, \nmechanics, astronomy, hydrostatics, and the other fashionable sciences of the day, and \ngradually began to produce a string of papers, with a particular emphasis on the motions of \nEarth and their effect on climate. \n    Croll was the first to suggest that cyclical changes in the shape of Earth\u2019s orbit, from \nelliptical (which is to say slightly oval) to nearly circular to elliptical again, might explain theonset and retreat of ice ages. No one had ever thought before to consider an astronomical \nexplanation for variations in Earth\u2019s weather. Thanks almost entirely to Croll\u2019s persuasive \ntheory, people in Britain began to become more responsive to the notion that at some former \ntime parts of the Earth had been in the grip of ice. When his ingenuity and aptitude were \nrecognized, Croll was given a job at the Geological Survey of Scotland and widely honored: \nhe was made a fellow of the Royal Society in London and of the New York Academy of \nScience and given an honorary degree from the University of St. Andrews, among much else. \n    Unfortunately, just as Agassiz\u2019s theory was at last beginning to find converts in Europe, he \nwas busy taking it into ever more exotic territory in America. He began to find evidence for \nglaciers practically everywhere he looked, including near the equator. Eventually he became \nconvinced that ice had once covered the whole Earth, extinguishing all life, which God had \nthen re-created. None of the evidence Agassiz cited supported such a view. Nonetheless, in \nhis adopted country his stature grew and grew until he was regarded as only slightly below a \ndeity. When he died in 1873 Harvard felt it necessary to appoint three professors to take his \nplace. \n    Yet, as sometimes happens, his theories fell swiftly out of fashion. Less than a decade after \nhis death his successor in the chair of geology at Harvard wrote that the \u201cso-called glacial \nepoch . . . so popular a few years ago among glacial geologists may now be rejected without \nhesitation.\u201d \n     Part of the problem was that Croll\u2019s computations suggested that the most recent ice age \noccurred eighty thousand years ago, whereas the geological evidence increasingly indicated \nthat Earth had undergone some sort of dramatic perturbation much more recently than that. \nWithout a plausible explanation for what might have provoked an ice age, the whole theory \nfell into abeyance. There it might have remained for some time except that in the early 1900s \na Serbian academic named Milutin Milankovitch, who had no background in celestial motions \nat all\u2014he was a mechanical engineer by training\u2014developed an unexpected interest in the \nmatter. Milankovitch realized that the problem with Croll\u2019s theory was not that it was \nincorrect but that it was too simple. \n    As Earth moves through space, it is subject not just to variations in the length and shape of \nits orbit, but also to rhythmic shifts in its angle of orientation to the Sun\u2014its tilt and pitch and \nwobble\u2014all affecting the length and intensity of sunlight falling on any patch of land. In \nparticular it is subject to three changes in position, known formally as its obliquity, \nprecession, and eccentricity, over long periods of time. Milankovitch wondered if there might \nbe a relationship between these complex cycles and the comings and goings of ice ages. The \ndifficulty was that the cycles were of widely different lengths\u2014of approximately 20,000, \n40,000, and 100,000 years, but varying in each case by up to a few thousand years\u2014which \nmeant that determining their points of intersection over long spans of time involved a nearly \nendless amount of devoted computation. Essentially Milankovitch had to work out the angle \nand duration of incoming solar radiation at every latitude on Earth, in every season, for a \nmillion years, adjusted for three ever-changing variables. \n    Happily this was precisely the sort of repetitive toil that suited Milankovitch\u2019s \ntemperament. For the next twenty years, even while on vacation, he worked ceaselessly with \npencil and slide rule computing the tables of his cycles\u2014work that now could be completed in \na day or two with a computer. The calculations all had to be made in his spare time, but in \n1914 Milankovitch suddenly got a great deal of that when World War I broke out and he was \narrested owing to his position as a reservist in the Serbian army. He spent most of the nextfour years under loose house arrest in Budapest, required only to report to the police once a \nweek. The rest of his time was spent working in the library of the Hungarian Academy of \nSciences. He was possibly the happiest prisoner of war in history. \n    The eventual outcome of his diligent scribblings was the 1930 book Mathematical \nClimatology and the Astronomical Theory of Climatic Changes. Milankovitch was right that \nthere was a relationship between ice ages and planetary wobble, though like most people he \nassumed that it was a gradual increase in harsh winters that led to these long spells of \ncoldness. It was a Russian-German meteorologist, Wladimir K\u00f6ppen\u2014father-in-law of our \ntectonic friend Alfred Wegener\u2014who saw that the process was more subtle, and rather more \nunnerving, than that. \n    The cause of ice ages, K\u00f6ppen decided, is to be found in cool summers, not brutal winters. \nIf summers are too cool to melt all the snow that falls on a given area, more incoming sunlight \nis bounced back by the reflective surface, exacerbating the cooling effect and encouraging yet \nmore snow to fall. The consequence would tend to be self-perpetuating. As snow accumulated \ninto an ice sheet, the region would grow cooler, prompting more ice to accumulate. As the \nglaciologist Gwen Schultz has noted: \u201cIt is not necessarily the amount of snow that causes ice \nsheets but the fact that snow, however little, lasts.\u201d It is thought that an ice age could start \nfrom a single unseasonal summer. The leftover snow reflects heat and exacerbates the chilling \neffect. \u201cThe process is self-enlarging, unstoppable, and once the ice is really growing it \nmoves,\u201d says McPhee. You have advancing glaciers and an ice age. \n    In the 1950s, because of imperfect dating technology, scientists were unable to correlate \nMilankovitch\u2019s carefully worked-out cycles with the supposed dates of ice ages as then \nperceived, and so Milankovitch and his calculations increasingly fell out of favor. He died in \n1958, unable to prove that his cycles were correct. By this time, write John and Mary Gribbin, \n\u201cyou would have been hard pressed to find a geologist or meteorologist who regarded the \nmodel as being anything more than an historical curiosity.\u201d Not until the 1970s and the \nrefinement of a potassium-argon method for dating ancient seafloor sediments were his \ntheories finally vindicated. \n    The Milankovitch cycles alone are not enough to explain cycles of ice ages. Many other \nfactors are involved\u2014not least the disposition of the continents, in particular the presence of \nlandmasses over the poles\u2014but the specifics of these are imperfectly understood. It has been \nsuggested, however, that if you hauled North America, Eurasia, and Greenland just three \nhundred miles north we would have permanent and inescapable ice ages. We are very lucky, it \nappears, to get any good weather at all. Even less well understood are the cycles of \ncomparative balminess within ice ages, known as interglacials. It is mildly unnerving to \nreflect that the whole of meaningful human history\u2014the development of farming, the creation \nof towns, the rise of mathematics and writing and science and all the rest\u2014has taken place \nwithin an atypical patch of fair weather. Previous interglacials have lasted as little as eight \nthousand years. Our own has already passed its ten thousandth anniversary. \n    The fact is, we are still very much in an ice age; it\u2019s just a somewhat shrunken one\u2014though \nless shrunken than many people realize. At the height of the last period of glaciation, around \ntwenty thousand years ago, about 30 percent of the Earth\u2019s land surface was under ice. Ten \npercent still is\u2014and a further 14 percent is in a state of permafrost. Three-quarters of all the \nfresh water on Earth is locked up in ice even now, and we have ice caps at both poles\u2014a \nsituation that may be unique in Earth\u2019s history. That there are snowy winters through much ofthe world and permanent glaciers even in temperate places such as New Zealand may seem \nquite natural, but in fact it is a most unusual situation for the planet. \n    For most of its history until fairly recent times the general pattern for Earth was to be hot \nwith no permanent ice anywhere. The current ice age\u2014ice epoch really\u2014started about forty \nmillion years ago, and has ranged from murderously bad to not bad at all. Ice ages tend to \nwipe out evidence of earlier ice ages, so the further back you go the more sketchy the picture \ngrows, but it appears that we have had at least seventeen severe glacial episodes in the last 2.5 \nmillion years or so\u2014the period that coincides with the rise of Homo erectus in Africa \nfollowed by modern humans. Two commonly cited culprits for the present epoch are the rise \nof the Himalayas and the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, the first disrupting air flows, \nthe second ocean currents. India, once an island, has pushed two thousand kilometers into the \nAsian landmass over the last forty-five million years, raising not only the Himalayas, but also \nthe vast Tibetan plateau behind them. The hypothesis is that the higher landscape was not \nonly cooler, but diverted winds in a way that made them flow north and toward North \nAmerica, making it more susceptible to long-term chills. Then, beginning about five million \nyears ago, Panama rose from the sea, closing the gap between North and South America, \ndisrupting the flows of warming currents between the Pacific and Atlantic, and changing \npatterns of precipitation across at least half the world. One consequence was a drying out of \nAfrica, which caused apes to climb down out of trees and go looking for a new way of living \non the emerging savannas. \n    At all events, with the oceans and continents arranged as they are now, it appears that ice \nwill be a long-term part of our future. According to John McPhee, about fifty more glacial \nepisodes can be expected, each lasting a hundred thousand years or so, before we can hope for \na really long thaw. \n    Before fifty million years ago, Earth had no regular ice ages, but when we did have them \nthey tended to be colossal. A massive freezing occurred about 2.2 billion years ago, followed \nby a billion years or so of warmth. Then there was another ice age even larger than the first\u2014\nso large that some scientists are now referring to the age in which it occurred as the \nCryogenian, or super ice age. The condition is more popularly known as Snowball Earth. \n    \u201cSnowball,\u201d however, barely captures the murderousness of conditions. The theory is that \nbecause of a fall in solar radiation of about 6 percent and a dropoff in the production (or \nretention) of greenhouse gases, Earth essentially lost its ability to hold on to its heat. It \nbecame a kind of all-over Antarctica. Temperatures plunged by as much as 80 degrees \nFahrenheit. The entire surface of the planet may have frozen solid, with ocean ice up to half a \nmile thick at higher latitudes and tens of yards thick even in the tropics. \n    There is a serious problem in all this in that the geological evidence indicates ice \neverywhere, including around the equator, while the biological evidence suggests just as \nfirmly that there must have been open water somewhere. For one thing, cyanobacteria \nsurvived the experience, and they photosynthesize. For that they needed sunlight, but as you \nwill know if you have ever tried to peer through it, ice quickly becomes opaque and after only \na few yards would pass on no light at all. Two possibilities have been suggested. One is that a \nlittle ocean water did remain exposed (perhaps because of some kind of localized warming at \na hot spot); the other is that maybe the ice formed in such a way that it remained translucent\u2014\na condition that does sometimes happen in nature.If Earth did freeze over, then there is the very difficult question of how it ever got warm \nagain. An icy planet should reflect so much heat that it would stay frozen forever. It appears \nthat rescue may have come from our molten interior. Once again, we may be indebted to \ntectonics for allowing us to be here. The idea is that we were saved by volcanoes, which \npushed through the buried surface, pumping out lots of heat and gases that melted the snows \nand re-formed the atmosphere. Interestingly, the end of this hyper-frigid episode is marked by \nthe Cambrian outburst\u2014the springtime event of life\u2019s history. In fact, it may not have been as \ntranquil as all that. As Earth warmed, it probably had the wildest weather it has ever \nexperienced, with hurricanes powerful enough to raise waves to the heights of skyscrapers \nand rainfalls of indescribable intensity. \n    Throughout all this the tubeworms and clams and other life forms adhering to deep ocean \nvents undoubtedly went on as if nothing were amiss, but all other life on Earth probably came \nas close as it ever has to checking out entirely. It was all a long time ago and at this stage we \njust don\u2019t know. \n    Compared with a Cryogenian outburst, the ice ages of more recent times seem pretty small \nscale, but of course they were immensely grand by the standards of anything to be found on \nEarth today. The Wisconsian ice sheet, which covered much of Europe and North America, \nwas two miles thick in places and marched forward at a rate of about four hundred feet a year. \nWhat a thing it must have been to behold. Even at their leading edge, the ice sheets could be \nnearly half a mile thick. Imagine standing at the base of a wall of ice two thousand feet high. \nBehind this edge, over an area measuring in the millions of square miles, would be nothing \nbut more ice, with only a few of the tallest mountain summits poking through. Whole \ncontinents sagged under the weight of so much ice and even now, twelve thousand years after \nthe glaciers\u2019 withdrawal, are still rising back into place. The ice sheets didn\u2019t just dribble out \nboulders and long lines of gravelly moraines, but dumped entire landmasses\u2014Long Island \nand Cape Cod and Nantucket, among others\u2014as they slowly swept along. It\u2019s little wonder \nthat geologists before Agassiz had trouble grasping their monumental capacity to rework \nlandscapes. \n    If ice sheets advanced again, we have nothing in our armory that could deflect them. In \n1964, at Prince William Sound in Alaska, one of the largest glacial fields in North America \nwas hit by the strongest earthquake ever recorded on the continent. It measured 9.2 on the \nRichter scale. Along the fault line, the land rose by as much as twenty feet. The quake was so \nviolent, in fact, that it made water slosh out of pools in Texas. And what effect did this \nunparalleled outburst have on the glaciers of Prince William Sound? None at all. They just \nsoaked it up and kept on moving. \n     For a long time it was thought that we moved into and out of ice ages gradually, over \nhundreds of thousands of years, but we now know that that has not been the case. Thanks to \nice cores from Greenland we have a detailed record of climate for something over a hundred \nthousand years, and what is found there is not comforting. It shows that for most of its recent \nhistory Earth has been nothing like the stable and tranquil place that civilization has known, \nbut rather has lurched violently between periods of warmth and brutal chill. \n    Toward the end of the last big glaciation, some twelve thousand years ago, Earth began to \nwarm, and quite rapidly, but then abruptly plunged back into bitter cold for a thousand years \nor so in an event known to science as the Younger Dryas. (The name comes from the arctic \nplant the dryas, which is one of the first to recolonize land after an ice sheet withdraws. There \nwas also an Older Dryas period, but it wasn\u2019t so sharp.) At the end of this thousand-yearonslaught average temperatures leapt again, by as much as seven degrees in twenty years, \nwhich doesn\u2019t sound terribly dramatic but is equivalent to exchanging the climate of \nScandinavia for that of the Mediterranean in just two decades. Locally, changes have been \neven more dramatic. Greenland ice cores show the temperatures there changing by as much as \nfifteen degrees in ten years, drastically altering rainfall patterns and growing conditions. This \nmust have been unsettling enough on a thinly populated planet. Today the consequences \nwould be pretty well unimaginable. \n    What is most alarming is that we have no idea\u2014none\u2014what natural phenomena could so \nswiftly rattle Earth\u2019s thermometer. As Elizabeth Kolbert, writing in the New Yorker, has \nobserved: \u201cNo known external force, or even any that has been hypothesized, seems capable \nof yanking the temperature back and forth as violently, and as often, as these cores have \nshown to be the case.\u201d There seems to be, she adds, \u201csome vast and terrible feedback loop,\u201d \nprobably involving the oceans and disruptions of the normal patterns of ocean circulation, but \nall this is a long way from being understood. \n    One theory is that the heavy inflow of meltwater to the seas at the beginning of the \nYounger Dryas reduced the saltiness (and thus density) of northern oceans, causing the Gulf \nStream to swerve to the south, like a driver trying to avoid a collision. Deprived of the Gulf \nStream\u2019s warmth, the northern latitudes returned to chilly conditions. But this doesn\u2019t begin to \nexplain why a thousand years later when the Earth warmed once again the Gulf Stream didn\u2019t \nveer as before. Instead, we were given the period of unusual tranquility known as the \nHolocene, the time in which we live now. \n    There is no reason to suppose that this stretch of climatic stability should last much longer. \nIn fact, some authorities believe that we are in for even worse than what went before. It is \nnatural to suppose that global warming would act as a useful counterweight to the Earth\u2019s \ntendency to plunge back into glacial conditions. However, as Kolbert has pointed out, when \nyou are confronted with a fluctuating and unpredictable climate \u201cthe last thing you\u2019d want to \ndo is conduct a vast unsupervised experiment on it.\u201d It has even been suggested, with more \nplausibility than would at first seem evident, that an ice age might actually be induced by a \nrise in temperatures. The idea is that a slight warming would enhance evaporation rates and \nincrease cloud cover, leading in the higher latitudes to more persistent accumulations of snow. \nIn fact, global warming could plausibly, if paradoxically, lead to powerful localized cooling in \nNorth America and northern Europe. \n    Climate is the product of so many variables\u2014rising and falling carbon dioxide levels, the \nshifts of continents, solar activity, the stately wobbles of the Milankovitch cycles\u2014that it is as \ndifficult to comprehend the events of the past as it is to predict those of the future. Much is \nsimply beyond us. Take Antarctica. For at least twenty million years after it settled over the \nSouth Pole Antarctica remained covered in plants and free of ice. That simply shouldn\u2019t have \nbeen possible. \n    No less intriguing are the known ranges of some late dinosaurs. The British geologist \nStephen Drury notes that forests within 10 degrees latitude of the North Pole were home to \ngreat beasts, including Tyrannosaurus rex. \u201cThat is bizarre,\u201d he writes, \u201cfor such a high \nlatitude is continually dark for three months of the year.\u201d Moreover, there is now evidence \nthat these high latitudes suffered severe winters. Oxygen isotope studies suggest that the \nclimate around Fairbanks, Alaska, was about the same in the late Cretaceous period as it is \nnow. So what was Tyrannosaurus doing there? Either it migrated seasonally over enormous \ndistances or it spent much of the year in snowdrifts in the dark. In Australia\u2014which at thattime was more polar in its orientation\u2014a retreat to warmer climes wasn\u2019t possible. How \ndinosaurs managed to survive in such conditions can only be guessed. \n    One thought to bear in mind is that if the ice sheets did start to form again for whatever \nreason, there is a lot more water for them to draw on this time. The Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, \nthe countless lakes of Canada\u2014these weren\u2019t there to fuel the last ice age. They were created \nby it. \n    On the other hand, the next phase of our history could see us melting a lot of ice rather than \nmaking it. If all the ice sheets melted, sea levels would rise by two hundred feet\u2014the height \nof a twenty-story building\u2014and every coastal city in the world would be inundated. More \nlikely, at least in the short term, is the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet. In the past fifty \nyears the waters around it have warmed by 2.5 degrees centigrade, and collapses have \nincreased dramatically. Because of the underlying geology of the area, a large-scale collapse \nis all the more possible. If so, sea levels globally would rise\u2014and pretty quickly\u2014by between \nfifteen and twenty feet on average. \n    The extraordinary fact is that we don\u2019t know which is more likely, a future offering us eons \nof perishing frigidity or one giving us equal expanses of steamy heat. Only one thing is \ncertain: we live on a knife edge. \n    In the long run, incidentally, ice ages are by no means bad news for the planet. They grind \nup rocks and leave behind new soils of sumptuous richness, and gouge out fresh water lakes \nthat provide abundant nutritive possibilities for hundreds of species of being. They act as a \nspur to migration and keep the planet dynamic. As Tim Flannery has remarked: \u201cThere is only \none question you need ask of a continent in order to determine the fate of its people: \u2018Did you \nhave a good ice age?\u2019 \u201d And with that in mind, it\u2019s time to look at a species of ape that truly \ndid.", "28": "28    THE MYSTERIOUS BIPED \n \n \n \nJUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS 1887, a young Dutch doctor with an un-Dutch name, Marie \nEug\u00e8ne Fran\u00e7ois Thomas Dubois, arrived in Sumatra, in the Dutch East Indies, with the \nintention of finding the earliest human remains on Earth.1  \n    Several things were extraordinary about this. To begin with, no one had ever gone looking \nfor ancient human bones before. Everything that had been found to this point had been found \naccidentally, and nothing in Dubois\u2019s background suggested that he was the ideal candidate to \nmake the process intentional. He was an anatomist by training with no background in \npaleontology. Nor was there any special reason to suppose that the East Indies would hold \nearly human remains. Logic dictated that if ancient people were to be found at all, it would be \non a large and long-populated landmass, not in the comparative fastness of an archipelago. \nDubois was driven to the East Indies on nothing stronger than a hunch, the availability of \nemployment, and the knowledge that Sumatra was full of caves, the environment in which \nmost of the important hominid fossils had so far been found. What is most extraordinary in all \nthis\u2014nearly miraculous, really\u2014is that he found what he was looking for. \n    At the time Dubois conceived his plan to search for a missing link, the human fossil record \nconsisted of very little: five incomplete Neandertal skeletons, one partial jawbone of uncertain \nprovenance, and a half-dozen ice-age humans recently found by railway workers in a cave at a \ncliff called Cro-Magnon near Les Eyzies, France. Of the Neandertal specimens, the best \npreserved was sitting unremarked on a shelf in London. It had been found by workers blasting \nrock from a quarry in Gibraltar in 1848, so its preservation was a wonder, but unfortunately \nno one yet appreciated what it was. After being briefly described at a meeting of the Gibraltar \nScientific Society, it had been sent to the Hunterian Museum in London, where it remained \nundisturbed but for an occasional light dusting for over half a century. The first formal \ndescription of it wasn\u2019t written until 1907, and then by a geologist named William Sollas \n\u201cwith only a passing competency in anatomy.\u201d \n    So instead the name and credit for the discovery of the first early humans went to the \nNeander Valley in Germany\u2014not unfittingly, as it happens, for by uncanny coincidence \nNeander in Greek means \u201cnew man.\u201d There in 1856 workmen at another quarry, in a cliff face \noverlooking the D\u00fcssel River, found some curious-looking bones, which they passed to a \nlocal schoolteacher, knowing he had an interest in all things natural. To his great credit the \nteacher, Johann Karl Fuhlrott, saw that he had some new type of human, though quite what it \nwas, and how special, would be matters of dispute for some time. \n    Many people refused to accept that the Neandertal bones were ancient at all. August Mayer, \na professor at the University of Bonn and a man of influence, insisted that the bones were \n                                                 \n1 Though Dutch, Dubois was from Eijsden, a town bordering the French-speaking part of Belgium.merely those of a Mongolian Cossack soldier who had been wounded while fighting in \nGermany in 1814 and had crawled into the cave to die. Hearing of this, T. H. Huxley in \nEngland drily observed how remarkable it was that the soldier, though mortally wounded, had \nclimbed sixty feet up a cliff, divested himself of his clothing and personal effects, sealed the \ncave opening, and buried himself under two feet of soil. Another anthropologist, puzzling \nover the Neandertal\u2019s heavy brow ridge, suggested that it was the result of long-term frowning \narising from a poorly healed forearm fracture. (In their eagerness to reject the idea of earlier \nhumans, authorities were often willing to embrace the most singular possibilities. At about the \ntime that Dubois was setting out for Sumatra, a skeleton found in P\u00e9rigueux was confidently \ndeclared to be that of an Eskimo. Quite what an ancient Eskimo was doing in southwest \nFrance was never comfortably explained. It was actually an early Cro-Magnon.) \n    It was against this background that Dubois began his search for ancient human bones. He \ndid no digging himself, but instead used fifty convicts lent by the Dutch authorities. For a year \nthey worked on Sumatra, then transferred to Java. And there in 1891, Dubois\u2014or rather his \nteam, for Dubois himself seldom visited the sites\u2014found a section of ancient human cranium \nnow known as the Trinil skullcap. Though only part of a skull, it showed that the owner had \nhad distinctly nonhuman features but a much larger brain than any ape. Dubois called it \nAnthropithecus erectus (later changed for technical reasons to Pithecanthropus erectus) and \ndeclared it the missing link between apes and humans. It quickly became popularized as \u201cJava \nMan.\u201d Today we know it as Homo erectus. \n    The next year Dubois\u2019s workers found a virtually complete thighbone that looked \nsurprisingly modern. In fact, many anthropologists think itis modern, and has nothing to do \nwith Java Man. If it is an erectus bone, it is unlike any other found since. Nonetheless Dubois \nused the thighbone to deduce\u2014correctly, as it turned out\u2014that Pithecanthropus walked \nupright. He also produced, with nothing but a scrap of cranium and one tooth, a model of the \ncomplete skull, which also proved uncannily accurate. \n    In 1895, Dubois returned to Europe, expecting a triumphal reception. In fact, he met nearly \nthe opposite reaction. Most scientists disliked both his conclusions and the arrogant manner in \nwhich he presented them. The skullcap, they said, was that of an ape, probably a gibbon, and \nnot of any early human. Hoping to bolster his case, in 1897 Dubois allowed a respected \nanatomist from the University of Strasbourg, Gustav Schwalbe, to make a cast of the skullcap. \nTo Dubois\u2019s dismay, Schwalbe thereupon produced a monograph that received far more \nsympathetic attention than anything Dubois had written and followed with a lecture tour in \nwhich he was celebrated nearly as warmly as if he had dug up the skull himself. Appalled and \nembittered, Dubois withdrew into an undistinguished position as a professor of geology at the \nUniversity of Amsterdam and for the next two decades refused to let anyone examine his \nprecious fossils again. He died in 1940 an unhappy man. \n  \n    Meanwhile, and half a world away, in late 1924 Raymond Dart, the Australian-born head of \nanatomy at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, was sent a small but \nremarkably complete skull of a child, with an intact face, a lower jaw, and what is known as \nan endocast\u2014a natural cast of the brain\u2014from a limestone quarry on the edge of the Kalahari \nDesert at a dusty spot called Taung. Dart could see at once that the Taung skull was not of a \nHomo erectus like Dubois\u2019s Java Man, but from an earlier, more apelike creature. He placed \nits age at two million years and dubbed it Australopithecus africanus, or \u201csouthern ape man of \nAfrica.\u201d In a report to Nature, Dart called the Taung remains \u201camazingly human\u201d andsuggested the need for an entirely new family, Homo simiadae (\u201cthe man-apes\u201d), to \naccommodate the find. \n    The authorities were even less favorably disposed to Dart than they had been to Dubois. \nNearly everything about his theory\u2014indeed, nearly everything about Dart, it appears\u2014\nannoyed them. First he had proved himself lamentably presumptuous by conducting the \nanalysis himself rather than calling on the help of more worldly experts in Europe. Even his \nchosen name, Australopithecus, showed a lack of scholarly application, combining as it did \nGreek and Latin roots. Above all, his conclusions flew in the face of accepted wisdom. \nHumans and apes, it was agreed, had split apart at least fifteen million years ago in Asia. If \nhumans had arisen in Africa, why, that would make us Negroid, for goodness sake. It was \nrather as if someone working today were to announce that he had found the ancestral bones of \nhumans in, say, Missouri. It just didn\u2019t fit with what was known. \n    Dart\u2019s sole supporter of note was Robert Broom, a Scottish-born physician and \npaleontologist of considerable intellect and cherishably eccentric nature. It was Broom\u2019s \nhabit, for instance, to do his fieldwork naked when the weather was warm, which was often. \nHe was also known for conducting dubious anatomical experiments on his poorer and more \ntractable patients. When the patients died, which was also often, he would sometimes bury \ntheir bodies in his back garden to dig up for study later. \n    Broom was an accomplished paleontologist, and since he was also resident in South Africa \nhe was able to examine the Taung skull at first hand. He could see at once that it was as \nimportant as Dart supposed and spoke out vigorously on Dart\u2019s behalf, but to no effect. For \nthe next fifty years the received wisdom was that the Taung child was an ape and nothing \nmore. Most textbooks didn\u2019t even mention it. Dart spent five years working up a monograph, \nbut could find no one to publish it. Eventually he gave up the quest to publish altogether \n(though he did continue hunting for fossils). For years, the skull\u2014today recognized as one of \nthe supreme treasures of anthropology\u2014sat as a paperweight on a colleague\u2019s desk. \n    At the time Dart made his announcement in 1924, only four categories of ancient hominid \nwere known\u2014Homo heidelbergensis, Homo rhodesiensis, Neandertals, and Dubois\u2019s Java \nMan\u2014but all that was about to change in a very big way. \n    First, in China, a gifted Canadian amateur named Davidson Black began to poke around at \na place, Dragon Bone Hill, that was locally famous as a hunting ground for old bones. \nUnfortunately, rather than preserving the bones for study, the Chinese ground them up to \nmake medicines. We can only guess how many priceless Homo erectus bones ended up as a \nsort of Chinese equivalent of bicarbonate of soda. The site had been much denuded by the \ntime Black arrived, but he found a single fossilized molar and on the basis of that alone quite \nbrilliantly announced the discovery of Sinanthropus pekinensis, which quickly became known \nas Peking Man. \n    At Black\u2019s urging, more determined excavations were undertaken and many other bones \nfound. Unfortunately all were lost the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 \nwhen a contingent of U.S. Marines, trying to spirit the bones (and themselves) out of the \ncountry, was intercepted by the Japanese and imprisoned. Seeing that their crates held nothing \nbut bones, the Japanese soldiers left them at the roadside. It was the last that was ever seen of \nthem.In the meantime, back on Dubois\u2019s old turf of Java, a team led by Ralph von Koenigswald \nhad found another group of early humans, which became known as the Solo People from the \nsite of their discovery on the Solo River at Ngandong. Koenigswald\u2019s discoveries might have \nbeen more impressive still but for a tactical error that was realized too late. He had offered \nlocals ten cents for every piece of hominid bone they could come up with, then discovered to \nhis horror that they had been enthusiastically smashing large pieces into small ones to \nmaximize their income. \n    In the following years as more bones were found and identified there came a flood of new \nnames\u2014Homo aurignacensis, Australopithecus transvaalensis, Paranthropus crassidens, \nZinjanthropus boisei,and scores of others, nearly all involving a new genus type as well as a \nnew species. By the 1950s, the number of named hominid types had risen to comfortably over \na hundred. To add to the confusion, individual forms often went by a succession of different \nnames as paleoanthropologists refined, reworked, and squabbled over classifications. Solo \nPeople were known variously as Homo soloensis, Homo primigenius asiaticus, Homo \nneanderthalensis soloensis, Homo sapiens soloensis, Homo erectus erectus, and, finally, plain \nHomo erectus . \n    In an attempt to introduce some order, in 1960 F. Clark Howell of the University of \nChicago, following the suggestions of Ernst Mayr and others the previous decade, proposed \ncutting the number of genera to just two\u2014Australopithecus and Homo \u2014and rationalizing \nmany of the species. The Java and Peking men both became Homo erectus. For a time order \nprevailed in the world of the hominids.2 It didn\u2019t last. \n    After about a decade of comparative calm, paleoanthropology embarked on another period \nof swift and prolific discovery, which hasn\u2019t abated yet. The 1960s produced Homo habilis, \nthought by some to be the missing link between apes and humans, but thought by others not to \nbe a separate species at all. Then came (among many others) Homo ergaster, Homo \nlouisleakeyi, Homo rudolfensis, Homo microcranus, and Homo antecessor, as well as a raft of \naustralopithecines: A.afarensis, A. praegens, A. ramidus, A. walkeri, A. anamensis, and still \nothers. Altogether, some twenty types of hominid are recognized in the literature today. \nUnfortunately, almost no two experts recognize the same twenty. \n    Some continue to observe the two hominid genera suggested by Howell in 1960, but others \nplace some of the australopithecines in a separate genus called Paranthropus , and still others \nadd an earlier group called Ardipithecus. Some put praegens into Australopithecus and some \ninto a new classification, Homo antiquus, but most don\u2019t recognize praegens as a separate \nspecies at all. There is no central authority that rules on these things. The only way a name \nbecomes accepted is by consensus, and there is often very little of that. \n    A big part of the problem, paradoxically, is a shortage of evidence. Since the dawn of time, \nseveral billion human (or humanlike) beings have lived, each contributing a little genetic \nvariability to the total human stock. Out of this vast number, the whole of our understanding \nof human prehistory is based on the remains, often exceedingly fragmentary, of perhaps five \nthousand individuals. \u201cYou could fit it all into the back of a pickup truck if you didn\u2019t mind \n                                                 \n2 Humans are put in the lamely Homimdae. Its members, traditionally called hominids, include any creatures \n(including extinct ones) that are more closely related to us than to any surviving chimpanzees. The apes, \nmeanwhile, are lumped together in a family called Pongidae. Many authorities believe that chimps, gorillas, and \norangutans should also be included in this family, with humans and chimps in a subfamily called Homininae. \nThe upshot is that the creatures traditionally called hominids become, under this arrangement, hominins. (Leakey \nand others insist on that designation.) Hominoidea is the name of the aue sunerfamily which includes us.how much you jumbled everything up,\u201d Ian Tattersall, the bearded and friendly curator of \nanthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, replied when I asked \nhim the size of the total world archive of hominid and early human bones. \n    The shortage wouldn\u2019t be so bad if the bones were distributed evenly through time and \nspace, but of course they are not. They appear randomly, often in the most tantalizing fashion. \nHomo erectus walked the Earth for well over a million years and inhabited territory from the \nAtlantic edge of Europe to the Pacific side of China, yet if you brought back to life every \nHomo erectus individual whose existence we can vouch for, they wouldn\u2019t fill a school bus. \nHomo habilis consists of even less: just two partial skeletons and a number of isolated limb \nbones. Something as short-lived as our own civilization would almost certainly not be known \nfrom the fossil record at all. \n    \u201cIn Europe,\u201d Tattersall offers by way of illustration, \u201cyou\u2019ve got hominid skulls in Georgia \ndated to about 1.7 million years ago, but then you have a gap of almost a million years before \nthe next remains turn up in Spain, right on the other side of the continent, and then you\u2019ve got \nanother 300,000-year gap before you get a Homo heidelbergensis in Germany\u2014and none of \nthem looks terribly much like any of the others.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s from these kinds of \nfragmentary pieces that you\u2019re trying to work out the histories of entire species. It\u2019s quite a \ntall order. We really have very little idea of the relationships between many ancient species\u2014\nwhich led to us and which were evolutionary dead ends. Some probably don\u2019t deserve to be \nregarded as separate species at all.\u201d \n    It is the patchiness of the record that makes each new find look so sudden and distinct from \nall the others. If we had tens of thousands of skeletons distributed at regular intervals through \nthe historical record, there would be appreciably more degrees of shading. Whole new species \ndon\u2019t emerge instantaneously, as the fossil record implies, but gradually out of other, existing \nspecies. The closer you go back to a point of divergence, the closer the similarities are, so that \nit becomes exceedingly difficult, and sometimes impossible, to distinguish a late Homo \nerectus from an early Homo sapiens, since it is likely to be both and neither. Similar \ndisagreements can often arise over questions of identification from fragmentary remains\u2014\ndeciding, for instance, whether a particular bone represents a female Australopithecus boisei \nor a male Homo habilis. \nWith so little to be certain about, scientists often have to make assumptions based on other \nobjects found nearby, and these may be little more than valiant guesses. As Alan Walker and \nPat Shipman have drily observed, if you correlate tool discovery with the species of creature \nmost often found nearby, you would have to conclude that early hand tools were mostly made \nby antelopes. \n    Perhaps nothing better typifies the confusion than the fragmentary bundle of contradictions \nthat was Homo habilis. Simply put, habilis bones make no sense. When arranged in sequence, \nthey show males and females evolving at different rates and in different directions\u2014the males \nbecoming less apelike and more human with time, while females from the same period appear \nto be moving away from humanness toward greater apeness. Some authorities don\u2019t believe \nhabilis is a valid category at all. Tattersall and his colleague Jeffrey Schwartz dismiss it as a \nmere \u201cwastebasket species\u201d\u2014one into which unrelated fossils \u201ccould be conveniently swept.\u201d \nEven those who see habilis as an independent species don\u2019t agree on whether it is of the same \ngenus as us or is from a side branch that never came to anything.Finally, but perhaps above all, human nature is a factor in all this. Scientists have a natural \ntendency to interpret finds in the way that most flatters their stature. It is a rare paleontologist \nindeed who announces that he has found a cache of bones but that they are nothing to get \nexcited about. Or as John Reader understatedly observes in the book Missing Links, \u201cIt is \nremarkable how often the first interpretations of new evidence have confirmed the \npreconceptions of its discoverer.\u201d \n    All this leaves ample room for arguments, of course, and nobody likes to argue more than \npaleoanthropologists. \u201cAnd of all the disciplines in science, paleoanthropology boasts perhaps \nthe largest share of egos,\u201d say the authors of the recent Java Man \u2014a book, it may be noted, \nthat itself devotes long, wonderfully unselfconscious passages to attacks on the inadequacies \nof others, in particular the authors\u2019 former close colleague Donald Johanson. Here is a small \nsampling: \n    \n    In our years of collaboration at the institute he [Johanson] developed a well-\ndeserved, if unfortunate, reputation for unpredictable and high-decibel personal \nverbal assaults, sometimes accompanied by the tossing around of books or \nwhatever else came conveniently to hand. \n    So, bearing in mind that there is little you can say about human prehistory that won\u2019t be \ndisputed by someone somewhere, other than that we most certainly had one, what we think \nwe know about who we are and where we come from is roughly this: \n    For the first 99.99999 percent of our history as organisms, we were in the same ancestral \nline as chimpanzees. Virtually nothing is known about the prehistory of chimpanzees, but \nwhatever they were, we were. Then about seven million years ago something major happened. \nA group of new beings emerged from the tropical forests of Africa and began to move about \non the open savanna. \n    These were the australopithecines, and for the next five million years they would be the \nworld\u2019s dominant hominid species. (Austral is from the Latin for \u201csouthern\u201d and has no \nconnection in this context to Australia.) Australopithecines came in several varieties, some \nslender and gracile, like Raymond Dart\u2019s Taung child, others more sturdy and robust, but all \nwere capable of walking upright. Some of these species existed for well over a million years, \nothers for a more modest few hundred thousand, but it is worth bearing in mind that even the \nleast successful had histories many times longer than we have yet achieved. \n    The most famous hominid remains in the world are those of a 3.18-million-year-old \naustralopithecine found at Hadar in Ethiopia in 1974 by a team led by Donald Johanson. \nFormally known as A.L. (for \u201cAfar Locality\u201d) 288\u20131, the skeleton became more familiarly \nknown as Lucy, after the Beatles song \u201cLucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\u201d Johanson has never \ndoubted her importance. \u201cShe is our earliest ancestor, the missing link between ape and \nhuman,\u201d he has said. \n    Lucy was tiny\u2014just three and a half feet tall. She could walk, though how well is a matter \nof some dispute. She was evidently a good climber, too. Much else is unknown. Her skull was \nalmost entirely missing, so little could be said with confidence about her brain size, though \nskull fragments suggested it was small. Most books describe Lucy\u2019s skeleton as being 40 \npercent complete, though some put it closer to half, and one produced by the American \nMuseum of Natural History describes Lucy as two-thirds complete. The BBC television seriesApe Man actually called it \u201ca complete skeleton,\u201d even while showing that it was anything \nbut. \n    A human body has 206 bones, but many of these are repeated. If you have the left femur \nfrom a specimen, you don\u2019t need the right to know its dimensions. Strip out all the redundant \nbones, and the total you are left with is 120\u2014what is called a half skeleton. Even by this fairly \naccommodating standard, and even counting the slightest fragment as a full bone, Lucy \nconstituted only 28 percent of a half skeleton (and only about 20 percent of a full one). \n    In The Wisdom of the Bones, Alan Walker recounts how he once asked Johanson how he \nhad come up with a figure of 40 percent. Johanson breezily replied that he had discounted the \n106 bones of the hands and feet\u2014more than half the body\u2019s total, and a fairly important half, \ntoo, one would have thought, since Lucy\u2019s principal defining attribute was the use of those \nhands and feet to deal with a changing world. At all events, rather less is known about Lucy \nthan is generally supposed. It isn\u2019t even actually known that she was a female. Her sex is \nmerely presumed from her diminutive size. \n    Two years after Lucy\u2019s discovery, at Laetoli in Tanzania Mary Leakey found footprints left \nby two individuals from\u2014it is thought\u2014the same family of hominids. The prints had been \nmade when two australopithecines had walked through muddy ash following a volcanic \neruption. The ash had later hardened, preserving the impressions of their feet for a distance of \nover twenty-three meters. \n    The American Museum of Natural History in New York has an absorbing diorama that \nrecords the moment of their passing. It depicts life-sized re-creations of a male and a female \nwalking side by side across the ancient African plain. They are hairy and chimplike in \ndimensions, but have a bearing and gait that suggest humanness. The most striking feature of \nthe display is that the male holds his left arm protectively around the female\u2019s shoulder. It is a \ntender and affecting gesture, suggestive of close bonding. \n    The tableau is done with such conviction that it is easy to overlook the consideration that \nvirtually everything above the footprints is imaginary. Almost every external aspect of the \ntwo figures\u2014degree of hairiness, facial appendages (whether they had human noses or chimp \nnoses), expressions, skin color, size and shape of the female\u2019s breasts\u2014is necessarily \nsuppositional. We can\u2019t even say that they were a couple. The female figure may in fact have \nbeen a child. Nor can we be certain that they were australopithecines. They are assumed to be \naustralopithecines because there are no other known candidates. \n    I had been told that they were posed like that because during the building of the diorama \nthe female figure kept toppling over, but Ian Tattersall insists with a laugh that the story is \nuntrue. \u201cObviously we don\u2019t know whether the male had his arm around the female or not, \nbut we do know from the stride measurements that they were walking side by side and close \ntogether\u2014close enough to be touching. It was quite an exposed area, so they were probably \nfeeling vulnerable. That\u2019s why we tried to give them slightly worried expressions.\u201d \n    I asked him if he was troubled about the amount of license that was taken in reconstructing \nthe figures. \u201cIt\u2019s always a problem in making re-creations,\u201d he agreed readily enough. \u201cYou \nwouldn\u2019t believe how much discussion can go into deciding details like whether Neandertals \nhad eyebrows or not. It was just the same for the Laetoli figures. We simply can\u2019t know the \ndetails of what they looked like, but we can convey their size and posture and make some \nreasonable assumptions about their probable appearance. If I had it to do again, I think I mighthave made them just slightly more apelike and less human. These creatures weren\u2019t humans. \nThey were bipedal apes.\u201d \n    Until very recently it was assumed that we were descended from Lucy and the Laetoli \ncreatures, but now many authorities aren\u2019t so sure. Although certain physical features (the \nteeth, for instance) suggest a possible link between us, other parts of the australopithecine \nanatomy are more troubling. In their book Extinct Humans, Tattersall and Schwartz point out \nthat the upper portion of the human femur is very like that of the apes but not of the \naustralopithecines; so if Lucy is in a direct line between apes and modern humans, it means \nwe must have adopted an australopithecine femur for a million years or so, then gone back to \nan ape femur when we moved on to the next phase of our development. They believe, in fact, \nthat not only was Lucy not our ancestor, she wasn\u2019t even much of a walker. \n    \u201cLucy and her kind did not locomote in anything like the modern human fashion,\u201d insists \nTattersall. \u201cOnly when these hominids had to travel between arboreal habitats would they find \nthemselves walking bipedally, \u2018forced\u2019 to do so by their own anatomies.\u201d Johanson doesn\u2019t \naccept this. \u201cLucy\u2019s hips and the muscular arrangement of her pelvis,\u201d he has written, \u201cwould \nhave made it as hard for her to climb trees as it is for modern humans.\u201d \n    Matters grew murkier still in 2001 and 2002 when four exceptional new specimens were \nfound. One, discovered by Meave Leakey of the famous fossil-hunting family at Lake \nTurkana in Kenya and called Kenyanthropus platyops (\u201cKenyan flat-face\u201d), is from about the \nsame time as Lucy and raises the possibility that it was our ancestor and Lucy was an \nunsuccessful side branch. Also found in 2001 were Ardipithecus ramidus kadabba, dated at \nbetween 5.2 million and 5.8 million years old, and Orrorin tugenensis, thought to be 6 million \nyears old, making it the oldest hominid yet found\u2014but only for a brief while. In the summer \nof 2002 a French team working in the Djurab Desert of Chad (an area that had never before \nyielded ancient bones) found a hominid almost 7 million years old, which they labeled \nSahelanthropus tchadensis. (Some critics believe that it was not human, but an early ape and \ntherefore should be called Sahelpithecus.) All these were early creatures and quite primitive \nbut they walked upright, and they were doing so far earlier than previously thought. \n    Bipedalism is a demanding and risky strategy. It means refashioning the pelvis into a full \nload-bearing instrument. To preserve the required strength, the birth canal must be \ncomparatively narrow. This has two very significant immediate consequences and one longer-\nterm one. First, it means a lot of pain for any birthing mother and a greatly increased danger \nof fatality to mother and baby both. Moreover to get the baby\u2019s head through such a tight \nspace it must be born while its brain is still small\u2014and while the baby, therefore, is still \nhelpless. This means long-term infant care, which in turn implies solid male\u2013female bonding. \n    All this is problematic enough when you are the intellectual master of the planet, but when \nyou are a small, vulnerable australopithecine, with a brain about the size of an orange,3 the \nrisk must have been enormous. \n                                                 \n3 Absolute brain size does not tell you everything-or possibly sometimes even much. Elephants and whales both \nhave brains larger than ours, but you wouldn't have much trouble outwitting them in contract negotiations. It is \nrelative size that matters, a point that is often overlooked. As Gould notes, A. africanus had a brain of only 450 \ncubic centimeters, smaller than that of a gorilla. But a typical africanus male weighed less than a hundred \npounds, and a female much less still, whereas gorillas can easily top out at 600 pounds (Gould pp. 181-83).So why did Lucy and her kind come down from the trees and out of the forests? Probably \nthey had no choice. The slow rise of the Isthmus of Panama had cut the flow of waters from \nthe Pacific into the Atlantic, diverting warming currents away from the Arctic and leading to \nthe onset of an exceedingly sharp ice age in northern latitudes. In Africa, this would have \nproduced seasonal drying and cooling, gradually turning jungle into savanna. \u201cIt was not so \nmuch that Lucy and her like left the forests,\u201d John Gribbin has written, \u201cbut that the forests \nleft them.\u201d \n    But stepping out onto the open savanna also clearly left the early hominids much more \nexposed. An upright hominid could see better, but could also be seen better. Even now as a \nspecies, we are almost preposterously vulnerable in the wild. Nearly every large animal you \ncan care to name is stronger, faster, and toothier than us. Faced with attack, modern humans \nhave only two advantages. We have a good brain, with which we can devise strategies, and \nwe have hands with which we can fling or brandish hurtful objects. We are the only creature \nthat can harm at a distance. We can thus afford to be physically vulnerable. \n    All the elements would appear to have been in place for the rapid evolution of a potent \nbrain, and yet that seems not to have happened. For over three million years, Lucy and her \nfellow australopithecines scarcely changed at all. Their brain didn\u2019t grow and there is no sign \nthat they used even the simplest tools. What is stranger still is that we now know that for \nabout a million years they lived alongside other early hominids who did use tools, yet the \naustralopithecines never took advantage of this useful technology that was all around them. \n    At one point between three and two million years ago, it appears there may have been as \nmany as six hominid types coexisting in Africa. Only one, however, was fated to last: Homo, \nwhich emerged from the mists beginning about two million years ago. No one knows quite \nwhat the relationship was between australopithecines and Homo, but what is known is that \nthey coexisted for something over a million years before all the australopithecines, robust and \ngracile alike, vanished mysteriously, and possibly abruptly, over a million years ago. No one \nknows why they disappeared. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d suggests Matt Ridley, \u201cwe ate them.\u201d \n    Conventionally, the Homo line begins with Homo habilis, a creature about whom we know \nalmost nothing, and concludes with us, Homo sapiens (literally \u201cman the thinker\u201d). In \nbetween, and depending on which opinions you value, there have been half a dozen other \nHomo species: Homo ergaster, Homo neanderthalensis, Homo rudolfensis, Homo \nheidelbergensis, Homo erectus, and Homo antecessor. \n    Homo habilis (\u201chandy man\u201d) was named by Louis Leakey and colleagues in 1964 and was \nso called because it was the first hominid to use tools, albeit very simple ones. It was a fairly \nprimitive creature, much more chimpanzee than human, but its brain was about 50 percent \nlarger than that of Lucy in gross terms and not much less large proportionally, so it was the \nEinstein of its day. No persuasive reason has ever been adduced for why hominid brains \nsuddenly began to grow two million years ago. For a long time it was assumed that big brains \nand upright walking were directly related\u2014that the movement out of the forests necessitated \ncunning new strategies that fed off of or promoted braininess\u2014so it was something of a \nsurprise, after the repeated discoveries of so many bipedal dullards, to realize that there was \nno apparent connection between them at all. \n    \u201cThere is simply no compelling reason we know of to explain why human brains got \nlarge,\u201d says Tattersall. Huge brains are demanding organs: they make up only 2 percent of the \nbody\u2019s mass, but devour 20 percent of its energy. They are also comparatively picky in whatthey use as fuel. If you never ate another morsel of fat, your brain would not complain \nbecause it won\u2019t touch the stuff. It wants glucose instead, and lots of it, even if it means short-\nchanging other organs. As Guy Brown notes: \u201cThe body is in constant danger of being \ndepleted by a greedy brain, but cannot afford to let the brain go hungry as that would rapidly \nlead to death.\u201d A big brain needs more food and more food means increased risk. \n    Tattersall thinks the rise of a big brain may simply have been an evolutionary accident. He \nbelieves with Stephen Jay Gould that if you replayed the tape of life\u2014even if you ran it back \nonly a relatively short way to the dawn of hominids\u2014the chances are \u201cquite unlikely\u201d that \nmodern humans or anything like them would be here now. \n    \u201cOne of the hardest ideas for humans to accept,\u201d he says, \u201cis that we are not the \nculmination of anything. There is nothing inevitable about our being here. It is part of our \nvanity as humans that we tend to think of evolution as a process that, in effect, was \nprogrammed to produce us. Even anthropologists tended to think this way right up until the \n1970s.\u201d Indeed, as recently as 1991, in the popular textbook The Stages of Evolution, C. \nLoring Brace stuck doggedly to the linear concept, acknowledging just one evolutionary dead \nend, the robust australopithecines. Everything else represented a straightforward \nprogression\u2014each species of hominid carrying the baton of development so far, then handing \nit on to a younger, fresher runner. Now, however, it seems certain that many of these early \nforms followed side trails that didn\u2019t come to anything. \n    Luckily for us, one did\u2014a group of tool users, which seemed to arise from out of nowhere \nand overlapped with the shadowy and much disputed Homo habilis. This is Homo erectus, the \nspecies discovered by Eug\u00e8ne Dubois in Java in 1891. Depending on which sources you \nconsult, it existed from about 1.8 million years ago to possibly as recently as twenty thousand \nor so years ago. \n    According to the Java Man authors, Homo erectus is the dividing line: everything that \ncame before him was apelike in character; everything that came after was humanlike. Homo \nerectus was the first to hunt, the first to use fire, the first to fashion complex tools, the first to \nleave evidence of campsites, the first to look after the weak and frail. Compared with all that \nhad gone before, Homo erectus was extremely human in form as well as behavior, its \nmembers long-limbed and lean, very strong (much stronger than modern humans), and with \nthe drive and intelligence to spread successfully over huge areas. To other hominids, Homo \nerectus must have seemed terrifyingly powerful, fleet, and gifted. \n    Erectus was \u201cthe velociraptor of its day,\u201d according to Alan Walker of Penn State \nUniversity and one of the world\u2019s leading authorities. If you were to look one in the eyes, it \nmight appear superficially to be human, but \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t connect. You\u2019d be prey.\u201d \nAccording to Walker, it had the body of an adult human but the brain of a baby. \n    Although erectus had been known about for almost a century it was known only from \nscattered fragments\u2014not enough to come even close to making one full skeleton. So it wasn\u2019t \nuntil an extraordinary discovery in Africa in the 1980s that its importance\u2014or, at the very \nleast, possible importance\u2014as a precursor species for modern humans was fully appreciated. \nThe remote valley of Lake Turkana (formerly Lake Rudolf) in Kenya is now one of the \nworld\u2019s most productive sites for early human remains, but for a very long time no one had \nthought to look there. It was only because Richard Leakey was on a flight that was diverted \nover the valley that he realized it might be more promising than had been thought. A team \nwas dispatched to investigate, but at first found nothing. Then late one afternoon KamoyaKimeu, Leakey\u2019s most renowned fossil hunter, found a small piece of hominid brow on a hill \nwell away from the lake. Such a site was unlikely to yield much, but they dug anyway out of \nrespect for Kimeu\u2019s instincts and to their astonishment found a nearly complete Homo erectus \nskeleton. It was from a boy aged between about nine and twelve who had died 1.54 million \nyears ago. The skeleton had \u201can entirely modern body structure,\u201d says Tattersall, in a way that \nwas without precedent. The Turkana boy was \u201cvery emphatically one of us.\u201d \n    Also found at Lake Turkana by Kimeu was KNM-ER 1808, a female 1.7 million years old, \nwhich gave scientists their first clue that Homo erectus was more interesting and complex \nthan previously thought. The woman\u2019s bones were deformed and covered in coarse growths, \nthe result of an agonizing condition called hypervitaminosis A, which can come only from \neating the liver of a carnivore. This told us first of all that Homo erectus was eating meat. \nEven more surprising was that the amount of growth showed that she had lived weeks or even \nmonths with the disease. Someone had looked after her. It was the first sign of tenderness in \nhominid evolution. \n    It was also discovered that Homo erectus skulls contained (or, in the view of some, possibly \ncontained) a Broca\u2019s area, a region of the frontal lobe of the brain associated with speech. \nChimps don\u2019t have such a feature. Alan Walker thinks the spinal canal didn\u2019t have the size \nand complexity to enable speech, that they probably would have communicated about as well \nas modern chimps. Others, notably Richard Leakey, are convinced they could speak. \n    For a time, it appears, Homo erectus was the only hominid species on Earth. It was hugely \nadventurous and spread across the globe with what seems to have been breathtaking rapidity. \nThe fossil evidence, if taken literally, suggests that some members of the species reached Java \nat about the same time as, or even slightly before, they left Africa. This has led some hopeful \nscientists to suggest that perhaps modern people arose not in Africa at all, but in Asia\u2014which \nwould be remarkable, not to say miraculous, as no possible precursor species have ever been \nfound anywhere outside Africa. The Asian hominids would have had to appear, as it were, \nspontaneously. And anyway an Asian beginning would merely reverse the problem of their \nspread; you would still have to explain how the Java people then got to Africa so quickly. \n    There are several more plausible alternative explanations for how Homo erectus managed \nto turn up in Asia so soon after its first appearance in Africa. First, a lot of plus-or-minusing \ngoes into the dating of early human remains. If the actual age of the African bones is at the \nhigher end of the range of estimates or the Javan ones at the lower end, or both, then there is \nplenty of time for African erects to find their way to Asia. It is also entirely possible that older \nerectus bones await discovery in Africa. In addition, the Javan dates could be wrong \naltogether. \n    Now for the doubts. Some authorities don\u2019t believe that the Turkana finds are Homo \nerectus at all. The snag, ironically, was that although the Turkana skeletons were admirably \nextensive, all othererectus fossils are inconclusively fragmentary. As Tattersall and Jeffrey \nSchwartz note in Extinct Humans, most of the Turkana skeleton \u201ccouldn\u2019t be compared with \nanything else closely related to it because the comparable parts weren\u2019t known!\u201d The Turkana \nskeletons, they say, look nothing like any Asian Homo erectus and would never have been \nconsidered the same species except that they were contemporaries. Some authorities insist on \ncalling the Turkana specimens (and any others from the same period) Homo ergaster. \nTattersall and Schwartz don\u2019t believe that goes nearly far enough. They believe it wasergaster \n\u201cor a reasonably close relative\u201d that spread to Asia from Africa, evolved intoHomo erectus, \nand then died out.What is certain is that sometime well over a million years ago, some new, comparatively \nmodern, upright beings left Africa and boldly spread out across much of the globe. They \npossibly did so quite rapidly, increasing their range by as much as twenty-five miles a year on \naverage, all while dealing with mountain ranges, rivers, deserts, and other impediments and \nadapting to differences in climate and food sources. A particular mystery is how they passed \nalong the west side of the Red Sea, an area of famously punishing aridity now, but even drier \nin the past. It is a curious irony that the conditions that prompted them to leave Africa would \nhave made it much more difficult to do so. Yet somehow they managed to find their way \naround every barrier and to thrive in the lands beyond. \n    And that, I\u2019m afraid, is where all agreement ends. What happened next in the history of \nhuman development is a matter of long and rancorous debate, as we shall see in the next \nchapter. \n    But it is worth remembering, before we move on, that all of these evolutionary jostlings \nover five million years, from distant, puzzled australopithecine to fully modern human, \nproduced a creature that is still 98.4 percent genetically indistinguishable from the modern \nchimpanzee. There is more difference between a zebra and a horse, or between a dolphin and \na porpoise, than there is between you and the furry creatures your distant ancestors left behind \nwhen they set out to take over the world.", "29": "29    THE RESTLESS APE \n \n \n \n \nSOMETIME ABOUT A million and a half years ago, some forgotten genius of the hominid \nworld did an unexpected thing. He (or very possibly she) took one stone and carefully used it \nto shape another. The result was a simple teardrop-shaped hand axe, but it was the world\u2019s \nfirst piece of advanced technology. \n    It was so superior to existing tools that soon others were following the inventor\u2019s lead and \nmaking hand axes of their own. Eventually whole societies existed that seemed to do little \nelse. \u201cThey made them in the thousands,\u201d says Ian Tattersall. \u201cThere are some places in \nAfrica where you literally can\u2019t move without stepping on them. It\u2019s strange because they are \nquite intensive objects to make. It was as if they made them for the sheer pleasure of it.\u201d \n    From a shelf in his sunny workroom Tattersall took down an enormous cast, perhaps a foot \nand a half long and eight inches wide at its widest point, and handed it to me. It was shaped \nlike a spearhead, but one the size of a stepping-stone. As a fiberglass cast it weighed only a \nfew ounces, but the original, which was found in Tanzania, weighed twenty-five pounds. \u201cIt \nwas completely useless as a tool,\u201d Tattersall said. \u201cIt would have taken two people to lift it \nadequately, and even then it would have been exhausting to try to pound anything with it.\u201d \n    \u201cWhat was it used for then?\u201d \n    Tattersall gave a genial shrug, pleased at the mystery of it. \u201cNo idea. It must have had some \nsymbolic importance, but we can only guess what.\u201d \n    The axes became known as Acheulean tools, after St. Acheul, a suburb of Amiens in \nnorthern France, where the first examples were found in the nineteenth century, and contrast \nwith the older, simpler tools known as Oldowan, originally found at Olduvai Gorge in \nTanzania. In older textbooks, Oldowan tools are usually shown as blunt, rounded, hand-sized \nstones. In fact, paleoanthropologists now tend to believe that the tool part of Oldowan rocks \nwere the pieces flaked off these larger stones, which could then be used for cutting. \n    Now here\u2019s the mystery. When early modern humans\u2014the ones who would eventually \nbecome us\u2014started to move out of Africa something over a hundred thousand years ago, \nAcheulean tools were the technology of choice. These early Homo sapiens loved their \nAcheulean tools, too. They carried them vast distances. Sometimes they even took unshaped \nrocks with them to make into tools later on. They were, in a word, devoted to the technology. \nBut although Acheulean tools have been found throughout Africa, Europe, and western and \ncentral Asia, they have almost never been found in the Far East. This is deeply puzzling.In the 1940s a Harvard paleontologist named Hallum Movius drew something called the \nMovius line, dividing the side with Acheulean tools from the one without. The line runs in a \nsoutheasterly direction across Europe and the Middle East to the vicinity of modern-day \nCalcutta and Bangladesh. Beyond the Movius line, across the whole of southeast Asia and \ninto China, only the older, simpler Oldowan tools have been found. We know that Homo \nsapiens went far beyond this point, so why would they carry an advanced and treasured stone \ntechnology to the edge of the Far East and then just abandon it? \n    \u201cThat troubled me for a long time,\u201d recalls Alan Thorne of the Australian National \nUniversity in Canberra. \u201cThe whole of modern anthropology was built round the idea that \nhumans came out of Africa in two waves\u2014a first wave of Homo erectus, which became Java \nMan and Peking Man and the like, and a later, more advanced wave of Homo sapiens, which \ndisplaced the first lot. Yet to accept that you must believe thatHomo sapiens got so far with \ntheir more modern technology and then, for whatever reason, gave it up. It was all very \npuzzling, to say the least.\u201d \n    As it turned out, there would be a great deal else to be puzzled about, and one of the most \npuzzling findings of all would come from Thorne\u2019s own part of the world, in the outback of \nAustralia. In 1968, a geologist named Jim Bowler was poking around on a long-dried lakebed \ncalled Mungo in a parched and lonely corner of western New South Wales when something \nvery unexpected caught his eye. Sticking out of a crescent-shaped sand ridge of a type known \nas a lunette were some human bones. At the time, it was believed that humans had been in \nAustralia for no more than 8,000 years, but Mungo had been dry for 12,000 years. So what \nwas anyone doing in such an inhospitable place? \n    The answer, provided by carbon dating, was that the bones\u2019 owner had lived there when \nLake Mungo was a much more agreeable habitat, a dozen miles long, full of water and fish, \nfringed by pleasant groves of casuarina trees. To everyone\u2019s astonishment, the bones turned \nout to be 23,000 years old. Other bones found nearby were dated to as much as 60,000 years. \nThis was unexpected to the point of seeming practically impossible. At no time since \nhominids first arose on Earth has Australia not been an island. Any human beings who arrived \nthere must have come by sea, in large enough numbers to start a breeding population, after \ncrossing sixty miles or more of open water without having any way of knowing that a \nconvenient landfall awaited them. Having landed, the Mungo people had then found their way \nmore than two thousand miles inland from Australia\u2019s north coast\u2014the presumed point of \nentry\u2014which suggests, according to a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of \nSciences, \u201cthat people may have first arrived substantially earlier than 60,000 years ago.\u201d \n    How they got there and why they came are questions that can\u2019t be answered. According to \nmost anthropology texts, there\u2019s no evidence that people could even speak 60,000 years ago, \nmuch less engage in the sorts of cooperative efforts necessary to build ocean-worthy craft and \ncolonize island continents. \n    \u201cThere\u2019s just a whole lot we don\u2019t know about the movements of people before recorded \nhistory,\u201d Alan Thorne told me when I met him in Canberra. \u201cDo you know that when \nnineteenth-century anthropologists first got to Papua New Guinea, they found people in the \nhighlands of the interior, in some of the most inaccessible terrain on earth, growing sweet \npotatoes. Sweet potatoes are native to South America. So how did they get to Papua New \nGuinea? We don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t have the faintest idea. But what is certain is that people have \nbeen moving around with considerable assuredness for longer than traditionally thought, and \nalmost certainly sharing genes as well as information.\u201dThe problem, as ever, is the fossil record. \u201cVery few parts of the world are even vaguely \namenable to the long-term preservation of human remains,\u201d says Thorne, a sharp-eyed man \nwith a white goatee and an intent but friendly manner. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for a few productive \nareas like Hadar and Olduvai in east Africa we\u2019d know frighteningly little. And when you \nlook elsewhere, often wedo know frighteningly little. The whole of India has yielded just one \nancient human fossil, from about 300,000 years ago. Between Iraq and Vietnam\u2014that\u2019s a \ndistance of some 5,000 kilometers\u2014there have been just two: the one in India and a \nNeandertal in Uzbekistan.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s not a whole hell of a lot to work with. You\u2019re \nleft with the position that you\u2019ve got a few productive areas for human fossils, like the Great \nRift Valley in Africa and Mungo here in Australia, and very little in between. It\u2019s not \nsurprising that paleontologists have trouble connecting the dots.\u201d \n    The traditional theory to explain human movements\u2014and the one still accepted by the \nmajority of people in the field\u2014is that humans dispersed across Eurasia in two waves. The \nfirst wave consisted of Homo erectus, who left Africa remarkably quickly\u2014almost as soon as \nthey emerged as a species\u2014beginning nearly two million years ago. Over time, as they settled \nin different regions, these early erects further evolved into distinctive types\u2014into Java Man \nand Peking Man in Asia, and Homo heidelbergensis and finally Homo neanderthalensis in \nEurope. \n    Then, something over a hundred thousand years ago, a smarter, lither species of creature\u2014\nthe ancestors of every one of us alive today\u2014arose on the African plains and began radiating \noutward in a second wave. Wherever they went, according to this theory, these new Homo \nsapiens displaced their duller, less adept predecessors. Quite how they did this has always \nbeen a matter of disputation. No signs of slaughter have ever been found, so most authorities \nbelieve the newer hominids simply outcompeted the older ones, though other factors may also \nhave contributed. \u201cPerhaps we gave them smallpox,\u201d suggests Tattersall. \u201cThere\u2019s no real way \nof telling. The one certainty is that we are here now and they aren\u2019t.\u201d \n    These first modern humans are surprisingly shadowy. We know less about ourselves, \ncuriously enough, than about almost any other line of hominids. It is odd indeed, as Tattersall \nnotes, \u201cthat the most recent major event in human evolution\u2014the emergence of our own \nspecies\u2014is perhaps the most obscure of all.\u201d Nobody can even quite agree where truly \nmodern humans first appear in the fossil record. Many books place their debut at about \n120,000 years ago in the form of remains found at the Klasies River Mouth in South Africa, \nbut not everyone accepts that these were fully modern people. Tattersall and Schwartz \nmaintain that \u201cwhether any or all of them actually represent our species still awaits definitive \nclarification.\u201d \n    The first undisputed appearance of Homo sapiens is in the eastern Mediterranean, around \nmodern-day Israel, where they begin to show up about 100,000 years ago\u2014but even there \nthey are described (by Trinkaus and Shipman) as \u201codd, difficult-to-classify and poorly \nknown.\u201d Neandertals were already well established in the region and had a type of tool kit \nknown as Mousterian, which the modern humans evidently found worthy enough to borrow. \nNo Neandertal remains have ever been found in north Africa, but their tool kits turn up all \nover the place. Somebody must have taken them there: modern humans are the only \ncandidate. It is also known that Neandertals and modern humans coexisted in some fashion \nfor tens of thousands of years in the Middle East. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they time-shared the \nsame space or actually lived side by side,\u201d Tattersall says, but the moderns continued happily \nto use Neandertal tools\u2014hardly convincing evidence of overwhelming superiority. No less \ncuriously, Acheulean tools are found in the Middle East well over a million years ago, butscarcely exist in Europe until just 300,000 years ago. Again, why people who had the \ntechnology didn\u2019t take the tools with them is a mystery. \n    For a long time, it was believed that the Cro-Magnons, as modern humans in Europe \nbecame known, drove the Neandertals before them as they advanced across the continent, \neventually forcing them to its western margins, where essentially they had no choice but to \nfall in the sea or go extinct. In fact, it is now known that Cro-Magnons were in the far west of \nEurope at about the same time they were also coming in from the east. \u201cEurope was a pretty \nempty place in those days,\u201d Tattersall says. \u201cThey may not have encountered each other all \nthat often, even with all their comings and goings.\u201d One curiosity of the Cro-Magnons\u2019 arrival \nis that it came at a time known to paleoclimatology as the Boutellier interval, when Europe \nwas plunging from a period of relative mildness into yet another long spell of punishing cold. \nWhatever it was that drew them to Europe, it wasn\u2019t the glorious weather. \n    In any case, the idea that Neandertals crumpled in the face of competition from newly \narrived Cro-Magnons strains against the evidence at least a little. Neandertals were nothing if \nnot tough. For tens of thousands of years they lived through conditions that no modern human \noutside a few polar scientists and explorers has experienced. During the worst of the ice ages, \nblizzards with hurricane-force winds were common. Temperatures routinely fell to 50 degrees \nbelow zero Fahrenheit. Polar bears padded across the snowy vales of southern England. \nNeandertals naturally retreated from the worst of it, but even so they will have experienced \nweather that was at least as bad as a modern Siberian winter. They suffered, to be sure\u2014a \nNeandertal who lived much past thirty was lucky indeed\u2014but as a species they were \nmagnificently resilient and practically indestructible. They survived for at least a hundred \nthousand years, and perhaps twice that, over an area stretching from Gibraltar to Uzbekistan, \nwhich is a pretty successful run for any species of being. \n    Quite who they were and what they were like remain matters of disagreement and \nuncertainty. Right up until the middle of the twentieth century the accepted anthropological \nview of the Neandertal was that he was dim, stooped, shuffling, and simian\u2014the \nquintessential caveman. It was only a painful accident that prodded scientists to reconsider \nthis view. In 1947, while doing fieldwork in the Sahara, a Franco-Algerian paleontologist \nnamed Camille Arambourg took refuge from the midday sun under the wing of his light \nairplane. As he sat there, a tire burst from the heat, and the plane tipped suddenly, striking him \na painful blow on the upper body. Later in Paris he went for an X-ray of his neck, and noticed \nthat his own vertebrae were aligned exactly like those of the stooped and hulking Neandertal. \nEither he was physiologically primitive or Neandertal\u2019s posture had been misdescribed. In \nfact, it was the latter. Neandertal vertebrae were not simian at all. It changed utterly how we \nviewed Neandertals\u2014but only some of the time, it appears. \n    It is still commonly held that Neandertals lacked the intelligence or fiber to compete on \nequal terms with the continent\u2019s slender and more cerebrally nimble newcomers, Homo \nsapiens. Here is a typical comment from a recent book: \u201cModern humans neutralized this \nadvantage [the Neandertal\u2019s considerably heartier physique] with better clothing, better fires \nand better shelter; meanwhile the Neandertals were stuck with an oversize body that required \nmore food to sustain.\u201d In other words, the very factors that had allowed them to survive \nsuccessfully for a hundred thousand years suddenly became an insuperable handicap. \n    Above all the issue that is almost never addressed is that Neandertals had brains that were \nsignificantly larger than those of modern people\u20141.8 liters for Neandertals versus 1.4 for \nmodern people, according to one calculation. This is more than the difference betweenmodern Homo sapiens and late Homo erectus , a species we are happy to regard as barely \nhuman. The argument put forward is that although our brains were smaller, they were \nsomehow more efficient. I believe I speak the truth when I observe that nowhere else in \nhuman evolution is such an argument made. \n    So why then, you may well ask, if the Neandertals were so stout and adaptable and \ncerebrally well endowed, are they no longer with us? One possible (but much disputed) \nanswer is that perhaps they are. Alan Thorne is one of the leading proponents of an alternative \ntheory, known as the multiregional hypothesis, which holds that human evolution has been \ncontinuous\u2014that just as australopithecines evolved into Homo habilis and Homo \nheidelbergensis became over time Homo neanderthalensis, so modernHomo sapiens simply \nemerged from more ancient Homo forms.Homo erectus is, on this view, not a separate species \nbut just a transitional phase. Thus modern Chinese are descended from ancient Homo erectus \nforebears in China, modern Europeans from ancient European Homo erectus, and so on. \n\u201cExcept that for me there are no Homo erectus,\u201d says Thorne. \u201cI think it\u2019s a term which has \noutlived its usefulness. For me, Homo erectus is simply an earlier part of us. I believe only \none species of humans has ever left Africa, and that species isHomo sapiens.\u201d \n    Opponents of the multiregional theory reject it, in the first instance, on the grounds that it \nrequires an improbable amount of parallel evolution by hominids throughout the Old World\u2014\nin Africa, China, Europe, the most distant islands of Indonesia, wherever they appeared. Some \nalso believe that multiregionalism encourages a racist view that anthropology took a very long \ntime to rid itself of. In the early 1960s, a famous anthropologist named Carleton Coon of the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania suggested that some modern races have different sources of \norigin, implying that some of us come from more superior stock than others. This hearkened \nback uncomfortably to earlier beliefs that some modern races such as the African \u201cBushmen\u201d \n(properly the Kalahari San) and Australian Aborigines were more primitive than others. \n    Whatever Coon may personally have felt, the implication for many people was that some \nraces are inherently more advanced, and that some humans could essentially constitute \ndifferent species. The view, so instinctively offensive now, was widely popularized in many \nrespectable places until fairly recent times. I have before me a popular book published by \nTime-Life Publications in 1961 called The Epic of Man based on a series of articles in Life \nmagazine. In it you can find such comments as \u201cRhodesian man . . . lived as recently as \n25,000 years ago and may have been an ancestor of the African Negroes. His brain size was \nclose to that of Homo sapiens.\u201d In other words black Africans were recently descended from \ncreatures that were only \u201cclose\u201d to Homo sapiens. \n    Thorne emphatically (and I believe sincerely) dismisses the idea that his theory is in any \nmeasure racist and accounts for the uniformity of human evolution by suggesting that there \nwas a lot of movement back and forth between cultures and regions. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to \nsuppose that people only went in one direction,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople were moving all over the \nplace, and where they met they almost certainly shared genetic material through \ninterbreeding. New arrivals didn\u2019t replace the indigenous populations, they joined them. They \nbecame them.\u201d He likens the situation to when explorers like Cook or Magellan encountered \nremote peoples for the first time. \u201cThey weren\u2019t meetings of different species, but of the same \nspecies with some physical differences.\u201d \n    What you actually see in the fossil record, Thorne insists, is a smooth, continuous \ntransition. \u201cThere\u2019s a famous skull from Petralona in Greece, dating from about 300,000 years \nago, that has been a matter of contention among traditionalists because it seems in some waysHomo erectus but in other ways Homo sapiens. Well, what we say is that this is just what you \nwould expect to find in species that were evolving rather than being displaced.\u201d \n    One thing that would help to resolve matters would be evidence of interbreeding, but that is \nnot at all easy to prove, or disprove, from fossils. In 1999, archeologists in Portugal found the \nskeleton of a child about four years old that died 24,500 years ago. The skeleton was modern \noverall, but with certain archaic, possibly Neandertal, characteristics: unusually sturdy leg \nbones, teeth bearing a distinctive \u201cshoveling\u201d pattern, and (though not everyone agrees on it) \nan indentation at the back of the skull called a suprainiac fossa, a feature exclusive to \nNeandertals. Erik Trinkaus of Washington University in St. Louis, the leading authority on \nNeandertals, announced the child to be a hybrid: proof that modern humans and Neandertals \ninterbred. Others, however, were troubled that the Neandertal and modern features weren\u2019t \nmore blended. As one critic put it: \u201cIf you look at a mule, you don\u2019t have the front end \nlooking like a donkey and the back end looking like a horse.\u201d \n    Ian Tattersall declared it to be nothing more than \u201ca chunky modern child.\u201d He accepts that \nthere may well have been some \u201chanky-panky\u201d between Neandertals and moderns, but \ndoesn\u2019t believe it could have resulted in reproductively successful offspring.1 \u201cI don\u2019t know \nof any two organisms from any realm of biology that are that different and still in the same \nspecies,\u201d he says. \n     With the fossil record so unhelpful, scientists have turned increasingly to genetic studies, \nin particular the part known as mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA was only discovered \nin 1964, but by the 1980s some ingenious souls at the University of California at Berkeley had \nrealized that it has two features that lend it a particular convenience as a kind of molecular \nclock: it is passed on only through the female line, so it doesn\u2019t become scrambled with \npaternal DNA with each new generation, and it mutates about twenty times faster than normal \nnuclear DNA, making it easier to detect and follow genetic patterns over time. By tracking the \nrates of mutation they could work out the genetic history and relationships of whole groups of \npeople. \n    In 1987, the Berkeley team, led by the late Allan Wilson, did an analysis of mitochondrial \nDNA from 147 individuals and declared that the rise of anatomically modern humans \noccurred in Africa within the last 140,000 years and that \u201call present-day humans are \ndescended from that population.\u201d It was a serious blow to the multiregionalists. But then \npeople began to look a little more closely at the data. One of the most extraordinary points\u2014\nalmost too extraordinary to credit really\u2014was that the \u201cAfricans\u201d used in the study were \nactually African-Americans, whose genes had obviously been subjected to considerable \nmediation in the past few hundred years. Doubts also soon emerged about the assumed rates \nof mutations. \n    By 1992, the study was largely discredited. But the techniques of genetic analysis \ncontinued to be refined, and in 1997 scientists from the University of Munich managed to \nextract and analyze some DNA from the arm bone of the original Neandertal man, and this \ntime the evidence stood up. The Munich study found that the Neandertal DNA was unlike any \nDNA found on Earth now, strongly indicating that there was no genetic connection between \nNeandertals and modern humans. Now this really was a blow to multiregionalism. \n                                                 \n1 One possibility is that Neandertals and Cro-Magnons had different numbers of chromosomes, a complication \nthat commonly arises when species that are close but not quite identical conjoin. In the equine world, for \nexample, horses have 64 chromosomes and donkeys 62. Mate the two and you get an offspring with a \nreproductively useless number of chromosomes, 63. You have, in short, a sterile mule.Then in late 2000 Nature and other publications reported on a Swedish study of the \nmitochondrial DNA of fifty-three people, which suggested that all modern humans emerged \nfrom Africa within the past 100,000 years and came from a breeding stock of no more than \n10,000 \nindividuals. \nSoon \nafterward, \nEric \nLander, \ndirector \nof \nthe \nWhitehead \nInstitute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Genome Research, announced that \nmodern Europeans, and perhaps people farther afield, are descended from \u201cno more than a \nfew hundred Africans who left their homeland as recently as 25,000 years ago.\u201d \n    As we have noted elsewhere in the book, modern human beings show remarkably little \ngenetic variability\u2014\u201cthere\u2019s more diversity in one social group of fifty-five chimps than in \nthe entire human population,\u201d as one authority has put it\u2014and this would explain why. \nBecause we are recently descended from a small founding population, there hasn\u2019t been time \nenough or people enough to provide a source of great variability. It seemed a pretty severe \nblow to multiregionalism. \u201cAfter this,\u201d a Penn State academic told the Washington Post, \n\u201cpeople won\u2019t be too concerned about the multiregional theory, which has very little \nevidence.\u201d \n    But all of this overlooked the more or less infinite capacity for surprise offered by the \nancient Mungo people of western New South Wales. In early 2001, Thorne and his colleagues \nat the Australian National University reported that they had recovered DNA from the oldest of \nthe Mungo specimens\u2014now dated at 62,000 years\u2014and that this DNA proved to be \n\u201cgenetically distinct.\u201d \n    The Mungo Man, according to these findings, was anatomically modern\u2014just like you and \nme\u2014but carried an extinct genetic lineage. His mitochondrial DNA is no longer found in \nliving humans, as it should be if, like all other modern people, he was descended from people \nwho left Africa in the recent past. \n    \u201cIt turned everything upside down again,\u201d says Thorne with undisguised delight. \n    Then other even more curious anomalies began to turn up. Rosalind Harding, a population \ngeneticist at the Institute of Biological Anthropology in Oxford, while studying betaglobin \ngenes in modern people, found two variants that are common among Asians and the \nindigenous people of Australia, but hardly exist in Africa. The variant genes, she is certain, \narose more than 200,000 years ago not in Africa, but in east Asia\u2014long before modern Homo \nsapiens reached the region. The only way to account for them is to say that ancestors of \npeople now living in Asia included archaic hominids\u2014Java Man and the like. Interestingly, \nthis same variant gene\u2014the Java Man gene, so to speak\u2014turns up in modern populations in \nOxfordshire. \n    Confused, I went to see Harding at the institute, which inhabits an old brick villa on \nBanbury Road in Oxford, in more or less the neighborhood where Bill Clinton spent his \nstudent days. Harding is a small and chirpy Australian, from Brisbane originally, with the rare \nknack for being amused and earnest at the same time. \n    \u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d she said at once, grinning, when I asked her how people in Oxfordshire \nharbored sequences of betaglobin that shouldn\u2019t be there. \u201cOn the whole,\u201d she went on more \nsomberly, \u201cthe genetic record supports the out-of-Africa hypothesis. But then you find these \nanomalous clusters, which most geneticists prefer not to talk about. There\u2019s huge amounts of \ninformation that would be available to us if only we could understand it, but we don\u2019t yet. \nWe\u2019ve barely begun.\u201d She refused to be drawn out on what the existence of Asian-origingenes in Oxfordshire tells us other than that the situation is clearly complicated. \u201cAll we can \nsay at this stage is that it is very untidy and we don\u2019t really know why.\u201d \n    At the time of our meeting, in early 2002, another Oxford scientist named Bryan Sykes had \njust produced a popular book called The Seven Daughters of Eve in which, using studies of \nmitochondrial DNA, he had claimed to be able to trace nearly all living Europeans back to a \nfounding population of just seven women\u2014the daughters of Eve of the title\u2014who lived \nbetween 10,000 and 45,000 years ago in the time known to science as the Paleolithic. To each \nof these women Sykes had given a name\u2014Ursula, Xenia, Jasmine, and so on\u2014and even a \ndetailed personal history. (\u201cUrsula was her mother\u2019s second child. The first had been taken by \na leopard when he was only two. . . .\u201d) \n    When I asked Harding about the book, she smiled broadly but carefully, as if not quite \ncertain where to go with her answer. \u201cWell, I suppose you must give him some credit for \nhelping to popularize a difficult subject,\u201d she said and paused thoughtfully. \u201cAnd there \nremains the remote possibility that he\u2019s right.\u201d She laughed, then went on more intently: \n\u201cData from any single gene cannot really tell you anything so definitive. If you follow the \nmitochondrial DNA backwards, it will take you to a certain place\u2014to an Ursula or Tara or \nwhatever. But if you take any other bit of DNA, any gene at all, and traceit back, it will take \nyou someplace else altogether.\u201d \n    It was a little, I gathered, like following a road randomly out of London and finding that \neventually it ends at John O\u2019Groats, and concluding from this that anyone in London must \ntherefore have come from the north of Scotland. They might have come from there, of course, \nbut equally they could have arrived from any of hundreds of other places. In this sense, \naccording to Harding, every gene is a different highway, and we have only barely begun to \nmap the routes. \u201cNo single gene is ever going to tell you the whole story,\u201d she said. \n    So genetic studies aren\u2019t to be trusted? \n    \u201cOh you can trust the studies well enough, generally speaking. What you can\u2019t trust are the \nsweeping conclusions that people often attach to them.\u201d \n    She thinks out-of-Africa is \u201cprobably 95 percent correct,\u201d but adds: \u201cI think both sides have \ndone a bit of a disservice to science by insisting that it must be one thing or the other. Things \nare likely to turn out to be not so straightforward as either camp would have you believe. The \nevidence is clearly starting to suggest that there were multiple migrations and dispersals in \ndifferent parts of the world going in all kinds of directions and generally mixing up the gene \npool. That\u2019s never going to be easy to sort out.\u201d \n    Just at this time, there were also a number of reports questioning the reliability of claims \nconcerning the recovery of very ancient DNA. An academic writing in Nature had noted how \na paleontologist, asked by a colleague whether he thought an old skull was varnished or not, \nhad licked its top and announced that it was. \u201cIn the process,\u201d noted the Nature article, \u201clarge \namounts of modern human DNA would have been transferred to the skull,\u201d rendering it \nuseless for future study. I asked Harding about this. \u201cOh, it would almost certainly have been \ncontaminated already,\u201d she said. \u201cJust handling a bone will contaminate it. Breathing on it \nwill contaminate it. Most of the water in our labs will contaminate it. We are all swimming in \nforeign DNA. In order to get a reliably clean specimen you have to excavate it in sterile \nconditions and do the tests on it at the site. It is the trickiest thing in the world not to \ncontaminate a specimen.\u201dSo should such claims be treated dubiously? I asked. \n    Harding nodded solemnly. \u201cVery,\u201d she said. \n     If you wish to understand at once why we know as little as we do about human origins, I \nhave the place for you. It is to be found a little beyond the edge of the blue Ngong Hills in \nKenya, to the south and west of Nairobi. Drive out of the city on the main highway to \nUganda, and there comes a moment of startling glory when the ground falls away and you are \npresented with a hang glider\u2019s view of boundless, pale green African plain. \n    This is the Great Rift Valley, which arcs across three thousand miles of east Africa, \nmarking the tectonic rupture that is setting Africa adrift from Asia. Here, perhaps forty miles \nout of Nairobi, along the baking valley floor, is an ancient site called Olorgesailie, which once \nstood beside a large and pleasant lake. In 1919, long after the lake had vanished, a geologist \nnamed J. W. Gregory was scouting the area for mineral prospects when he came across a \nstretch of open ground littered with anomalous dark stones that had clearly been shaped by \nhuman hand. He had found one of the great sites of Acheulean tool manufacture that Ian \nTattersall had told me about. \n    Unexpectedly in the autumn of 2002 I found myself a visitor to this extraordinary site. I \nwas in Kenya for another purpose altogether, visiting some projects run by the charity CARE \nInternational, but my hosts, knowing of my interest in humans for the present volume, had \ninserted a visit to Olorgesailie into the schedule. \n    After its discovery by Gregory, Olorgesailie lay undisturbed for over two decades before \nthe famed husband-and-wife team of Louis and Mary Leakey began an excavation that isn\u2019t \ncompleted yet. What the Leakeys found was a site stretching to ten acres or so, where tools \nwere made in incalculable numbers for roughly a million years, from about 1.2 million years \nago to 200,000 years ago. Today the tool beds are sheltered from the worst of the elements \nbeneath large tin lean-tos and fenced off with chicken wire to discourage opportunistic \nscavenging by visitors, but otherwise the tools are left just where their creators dropped them \nand where the Leakeys found them. \n    Jillani Ngalli, a keen young man from the Kenyan National Museum who had been \ndispatched to act as guide, told me that the quartz and obsidian rocks from which the axes \nwere made were never found on the valley floor. \u201cThey had to carry the stones from there,\u201d he \nsaid, nodding at a pair of mountains in the hazy middle distance, in opposite directions from \nthe site: Olorgesailie and Ol Esakut. Each was about ten kilometers, or six miles, away\u2014a \nlong way to carry an armload of stone. \n    Why the early Olorgesailie people went to such trouble we can only guess, of course. Not \nonly did they lug hefty stones considerable distances to the lakeside, but, perhaps even more \nremarkably, they then organized the site. The Leakeys\u2019 excavations revealed that there were \nareas where axes were fashioned and others where blunt axes were brought to be resharpened. \nOlorgesailie was, in short, a kind of factory; one that stayed in business for a million years. \n    Various replications have shown that the axes were tricky and labor-intensive objects to \nmake\u2014even with practice, an axe would take hours to fashion\u2014and yet, curiously, they were \nnot particularly good for cutting or chopping or scraping or any of the other tasks to which \nthey were presumably put. So we are left with the position that for a million years\u2014far, far \nlonger than our own species has even been in existence, much less engaged in continuouscooperative efforts\u2014early people came in considerable numbers to this particular site to make \nextravagantly large numbers of tools that appear to have been rather curiously pointless. \n    And who were these people? We have no idea actually. We assume they were Homo \nerectus because there are no other known candidates, which means that at their peak\u2014their \npeak \u2014the Olorgesailie workers would have had the brains of a modern infant. But there is no \nphysical evidence on which to base a conclusion. Despite over sixty years of searching, no \nhuman bone has ever been found in or around the vicinity of Olorgesailie. However much \ntime they spent there shaping rocks, it appears they went elsewhere to die. \n    \u201cIt\u2019s all a mystery,\u201d Jillani Ngalli told me, beaming happily. \n    The Olorgesailie people disappeared from the scene about 200,000 years ago when the lake \ndried up and the Rift Valley started to become the hot and challenging place it is today. But \nby this time their days as a species were already numbered. The world was about to get its \nfirst real master race, Homo sapiens . Things would never be the same again."}
